One of my most favorite moments with Lisa was when she welcomed her two crazy soon-to-be sister-in-laws over to help her get ready for her wedding.  We laughed so much and she was so trusting of our care — Mary Claire even curled her hair!  I brought my fur wrap that I wore in my wedding so that she could be warm for her November wedding.  She was so beautiful, warm and peaceful and it was an honor to be with her in that moment.

Thanks for this Liz. I have basically no memory of our wedding. I just remembered that she fucking hated her haircut that she had for her wedding. She said it was the worst one she'd ever had.
