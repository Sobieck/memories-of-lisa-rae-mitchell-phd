One More Cup of Tea

If we could share one more cup of tea,

Lis, I would tell you the beauty I see

Your light shines, both inside and out,

No matter what we talked about
<br>
<br>

If we could have one more cup of tea,

I would thank you for your sweet company.

Your lovely heart, so kind and so true,

Has always blessed me to view.
<br>
<br>

If we could have one more cup of tea,

I would tell you how much you matter to me.

To many lives, you brought such a glow

Far more than you could ever know.
<br>
<br>

If we could share one more cup of tea,

I would tell you how much joy you give to me.

Your smile, your light, your laugh like a chime,

Bring warmth to my heart for all of time.
<br>
<br>

Oh, how I wish for one more cup of tea,

To marvel on how many things we agree.

To tell you, Lis, how you brighten my day,

And together remember to cast our cares away.
<br>
<br>

But I know that you are up above smiling at me

You-and that cup of tea-are waiting patiently.

Until that sweet day, I will speak of your name,

And by holding my friends closer, I will honor your flame.
<br>
<br>

For now, I make time for more cups of tea,

To share with my friends who are dear to me.

I will speak of your kindness and your loving, pure heart,

And carry your warmth until I depart
<br>
<br>

Someday I will join you, my dear, sweet Lis,

Where there are no tears, death, or pain -just peace

Someday I will join you, in eternity free,

And together we will share that sweet cup of tea.
