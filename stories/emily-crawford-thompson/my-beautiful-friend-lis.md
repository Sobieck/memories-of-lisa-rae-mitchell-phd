My Beautiful Friend Lis

• I remember a joke we shared when we worked together at the VA. I would call her
office phone and not say a word, just laugh hysterically. She told me how one time
when I did that she struggled to not bust out laughing, as her supervisor was in the
room at the time!

• I remember when she had the big orange cat Murrey, thinking how adorable Lis
looked sitting on the arm of her couch holding him tight, saying, “He makes me
happy!”

• Every time we visited, no matter how much time had passed, we picked up right
where we left off and felt more connected than ever. We would talk for hours and
hours as we had so much in common. If we had more time, we were sure we would
solve all the world’s problems!

• I remember her laugh. It was truly one-of-a-kind, delightful and melodic. I have
never heard another laugh like hers. It was very lovely.

• I remember her intelligence. She saw things from multiple angles and had great skill
in perspective. She was highly reflective, keenly perceptive, and deeply
compassionate.

• I remember her resilience, how hard she fought to stay strong throughout her health
ordeals. She told me once of an approach that helped her; rather than worrying
about the “what ifs” about the future, she came to accept “I don’t know.” To rest in
that kind of uncertainty, even for a moment, in the midst of such struggle and pain is
truly courageous and admirable. I strive to have that admirable strength during the
unknowns of life.

• I remember her every day as I get dressed, as most of my clothes were once hers.
We were the same size and when she could no longer work she gave me her
beautiful work clothes. She had excellent style.

• Lis was a born psychologist; she cared deeply about people and was genuinely non-
judgmental and accepting. She was an excellent listener and she knew how to
validate the nuances of emotional experience on a level perhaps better than anyone
I have ever met. She was incredibly intuitive. She was highly skilled at hearing the
unspoken. I always knew that I would leave a conversation with her enlightened,
with deeper understanding and insight. I know we both felt very fulfilled in our visits
together, which we cherished so much. I had so much more I had wanted to share
with her. I had so much more I wanted to learn from her. I had so much more life I
wanted to do with her, together, through all the ups and downs.

• Lis was incredibly generous and giving. Nothing made her happier than to do things
for others. She loved having me over for tea parties and giving me such thoughtful
gifts for my birthdays. She was an excellent cook and loved getting dressed up and
enjoying her beautiful tea sets. My lovely friend had such passion for life.

• I always thought we would have more time, so much more time. I was always
hopeful that her health would turn around. I had my parents praying for her every
day.

• Lis and I were, and remain, friends for life. She is one of a kind and so special to me.
She will always live in my memories and heart. She changed me for the better, in so
many countless ways, probably more than I even know. I know she lives on and I will
see her again someday.
