Growing up in different countries, we sadly didn't get very much time together, however whenever we did see each other, it was always so special, filled with laughs and wonderfully memorable moments. 

In addition to the fabulous family Christmas visits at Jandakot, where we would lay on the loungeroom floor chatting and giggling and just enjoy watching the antics of all the 'oldies', I fondly remember our girls trip to Margaret River.

Me being around perhaps 18/19 years, threw Lisa into my red Ford Falcon SPack and excitedly hit the road together.

Once Lisa became a bit more at ease with driving on the wrong side of the road, we had a absolute blast taking in the sites of Margs and I recall Lisa really loved the chocolate factory and it's free samples.

It was great, just a couple of cousins getting out of dodge and having an adventure on a girls trip away from the oldies.

I do recall a minor downside, getting tonsillitis and feeling absolutely terrible with fevers for the entire drive home, but I still would not have changed anything about our very treasured time together. I will remember with much love and happiness always.

Aunt Rod and Uncle Ray, please know that I have no true understanding of what you both must be feeling but I can only imagine your pain and I would take it away for you if I possibly could.

Thomas, I did not obviously know you, but I thank you for being there for my family and know you must be a caring soul if Lisa chose you to be her partner in life.

Please know my heart goes out to you both and all your extended family and friends at this time.

I would like you to know that there are heartfelt condolences being sent to you from all your Oz family.

Much LOVE ALWAYS

Bec Josh and Hunter WHEELER
