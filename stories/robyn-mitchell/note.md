Thomas Note: 

Lisa used to tell Robyn what to write in various documents. She used to do this with Thomas but it was so exhausting that he let Robyn take it over. Lisa was constantly wanting to add new things to the documents, reword something, etc etc. She did it all from memory and it was remarkable. 

Robyn said this when she sent the last document Lisa made. That document is in "lisas documents": 

"I can’t believe she kept this all in her head. I’m not sure what the line is about part way through but it was some kind of division in her mind."
