I just remembered what you asked me to send you that we were talking about yesterday. 

You and Lisa baked Christmas cookies to share with your neighbors. She decorated them and you delivered them. Then she remembered that one of the varieties had to be refrigerated so you had to go back to tell them as she was worried they might get sick.
