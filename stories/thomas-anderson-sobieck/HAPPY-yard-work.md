Lisa fucking loved mowing the lawn with our little electric mower. We have an enormous yard, but she would drape herself in a wet cloth and get out there. She just liked out satisfying it was to see something done. She was a therapist and progress and be frustrating. So she would do one battery, or sometimes two, and I would finish up. But she just loved working in the yard. She did so much gardening and mowing when we first moved into our house. Those things were the first things she lost (I think alcohol was before? She loved her wine back in the day) because exercise was just too much for her and would cause her pain. Bending over to weed just would leave her in pain for a long time. So giving up all that was hard. Because I hate all those tasks and hired people just didn't do it to her exacting standards.
