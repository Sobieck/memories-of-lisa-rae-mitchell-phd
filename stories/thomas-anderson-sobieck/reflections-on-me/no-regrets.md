I'm glad that I gave it my best. 

I have some regrets about the end of her life and the weeks leading up to it. For instance, I should have been more involved in preparing and attending her appointments with the new doctor. But this is just looking back with the benefit of hindsight. She said that I shouldn't participate because of my exhaustion and she always did really well in doctors appointments. She was sharp until the last few days.

I was also getting more and more frustrated with her waking me up in the middle of the night for things that weren't actually issues that needed immediate resolution. I don't know how many nights she did it, maybe 5, but I was (and still am) so bone deep tired that I needed my sleep. I think it is understandable if not great.

With all that said, I'm glad that I tried to make her life a bit easier for so long. People tell me that most folk wouldn't do the same, I have my doubts about that (I didn't have to worry about money), but it is good that I gave it my all. I'm glad that I attempted to put on a happy face to try to keep her mood up on all the days except my very worst. I probably was outwardly morose in here presence like 1 day a month, which is pretty decent given my levels of depression. 

I know that she absolutely would have done that for me at the minimum, and I'm pretty sure she would have gone even further.
