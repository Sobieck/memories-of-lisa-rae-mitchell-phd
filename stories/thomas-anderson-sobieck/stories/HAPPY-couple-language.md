Lisa and I had a lot of little sayings that we would use to communicate. 

One was beavering. I think it started when we saw the beaver when we were walking when we were first dating. See Happy-Beaver.md for more. But I think we started to use the idiom, "busy as a beaver." This eventually just evolved into beavering. "Wow I really beavered today. I'm so tired", "Gidget is really beavering", and the perennial, "Honey, you've been beavering way too much. Remember you have an energy budget and you need to get some rest."

Another one that I was always using was "sauce." At the end of her life Lisa had a ton of needs. So when she needed something liquid I would tell her I'm bringing her sauce. Her water bottles were sauce, various mouth washes, the cream I put on her wound, the medicated toe nail polish, etc 

Another one was "butter your biscuit." It referred primarily to putting toothpaste on her tooth brush at night but I think that we also used it about putting on her various creams. I know we used it for her skin moisturizer. I had to cover her feet with blankets a few times a day and that was referred to as buttering her biscuit as well.
