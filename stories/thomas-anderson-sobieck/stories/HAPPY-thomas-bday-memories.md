Lisa and I weren't too into dates. I didn't know her birthday until I started managing her medications. I still don't know the date when we met, were married, or any of that sort of thing. So we didn't celebrate birthdays that much. We did a little but it was never a big deal.

When I had jobs, I would always take the week of my birthday off. It made sense because Independence Day was a holiday so I could get a full week off for only 4 days of vacation time. 

Lisa loved shopping, so we'd tend to go shopping on my birthdays. I remember one year we went and got running shoes from Dick's Sporting Goods. I also got some socks. Lisa also bought cloths for walking the dog. She used to walk around the neighborhood with Gidget or Zoe. 

The other time I remember was when we went to all the furniture stores looking for a TV stand. We needed a new TV stand, I don't know why but Lisa wanted to spruce up the den. So we went to all the furniture store. I think at the first store I saw what we'd eventually buy. It is a little light green dresser. It isn't a traditional tv stand, but it was unique and cute. 

We ended up going all over town after that but we didn't like anything else, so we went back and got that dresser. It was a bit weird but I think we both liked it when we put it in the den.
