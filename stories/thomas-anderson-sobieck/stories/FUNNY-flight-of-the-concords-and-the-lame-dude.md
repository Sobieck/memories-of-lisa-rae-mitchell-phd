Lisa had a type I guess before she met me. Doctors. She was engaged to one at one point but that fell apart when he cheated on her with a nurse.  

But she was on a date with some sort of doctor in Pasadena. They went to his place and he put on Flight of the Concords for her and she just fucking lost it laughing so hard and very unladylike. This apparently was too much for this lame dude and Lisa never saw him again. 

But I thank that nameless dude because Lisa and I bonded over our love of that show very early in our relationship. It was probably one of the first conversations we had.
