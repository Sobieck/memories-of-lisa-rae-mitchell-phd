Lisa loved her job being a social worker. She would have liked to do that for the rest of her life but it paid so little. She always talked about how nice it was to see real solid results for her clients. She went into it because she wanted to help people.

She was a fierce advocate for her clients. She was super bull headed so if her client needed to get a ramp put in, she would harass the people who were to do it until it was done. And she loved people so getting to help in concrete ways was extremely satisfying for her.

One particular client she told me about a few times because he was so colorful. All of Lisa's coworkers refused to work with him because he had tons of naked lady posters on his walls. Like he was just super horny and loved women. Lisa was very petite and super attractive and she was in her 20s at this point, but she didn't see anything wrong with it and wasn't threatened. She treated him just like anyone else. 

Another reason she loved it is because she drove all over the place around Ukiah CA blaring her favorite music. Ukiah is apparently beautiful with redwoods and the like around it. And it is very spread out so to get to a single client Lisa might drive an hour. But she just loved the natural beauty and her music, and it was even better getting paid to do that.

Basically the job was bullying people to help people in need, and drive long distances. She love it so much.
