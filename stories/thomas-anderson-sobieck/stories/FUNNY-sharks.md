My parents used to have a wonderful little cottage on Lake Michigan. For much of my adolescence and teen years I would go up there the whole summer. It was wonderful. Lake Michigan is by far my favorite place in the world. 

But when Lisa and I were first dating we went up there a few times. Lake Michigan when you look at it looks exactly like an ocean. It is enormous. It is more of an inland sea than anything. 

Lisa had a big fear of sharks. When she was in school her friend and her would watch Shark Week on the Discovery channel all the time. 

So when we were up in Michigan I told her that there were sharks in there. I thought it was funny but it horrified her. She said, well there _could_ be sharks in there given that bullsharks can be in fresh water. I think we still swam in Michigan.

The other shark memory was when we were at my parents condo, Lisa said she was having trouble sleeping because she was thinking about the sharks swimming around down below us. I laughed and told her how her concerns were valid and that I believed that sharks were developing thumbs and were planning an uprising. We both laughed.
