![The photograph shows me standing outdoors in a snowy landscape. I appear to be middle-aged, with dark brown hair and a beard. I'm wearing a dark-colored, possibly black, blazer over a light blue t-shirt. My expression can be interpreted as neutral to slightly amused. The background is mostly blurred by the snowfall, but shows a line of bare, trees extending across the entire scene. Thereâ€™s a hint of a fence, partially obscured by the snow, separating the yard from a slightly elevated area in the background. A dark-colored object, possibly a trash can or similar container, is faintly visible on this higher ground. The ground is completely covered in a layer of fresh snow, with tire tracks barely visible in the snow.](https://github.com/Sobieck/memories-of-lisa-rae-mitchell-phd/blob/main/pictures/thomas-anderson-sobieck/2013/WP_000240.jpg?raw=true)

![Lisa i standing outdoors in a snowy landscape. The snow is falling heavily, creating a somewhat blurry, ethereal atmosphere. She is wearing a dark-colored, puffy winter jacket, and her expression is pleasant and seems relaxed. She is wearing glasses and has shoulder-length brown hair. She is wearing dark pants or skirt and in her left hand she is holding what looks like a dark-colored glove or mitten. The background is dominated by a snow-covered yard. Bare, leafless trees reach into a gray sky, giving the overall scene a wintery, somewhat somber but peaceful mood. In the foreground to Lisa's left is a dark-colored garbage can, also covered in snow. A partially visible green garden hose lies on the snow near the garbage can.](https://github.com/Sobieck/memories-of-lisa-rae-mitchell-phd/blob/main/pictures/thomas-anderson-sobieck/2013/WP_000238.jpg?raw=true)

![A snow-covered two-story house sits on a snowy lawn, with footprints leading towards it. The image shows a large, two-story house, light gray with white trim, covered in snow. The house has a wraparound porch with white pillars and dark gray railings. The roof is also covered in snow, and it has a large dormer window on the top center.  There are several windows visible, showing a glimpse of the interior. The front door is visible and appears to be dark colored. Two small, leafless trees are in the foreground, also covered in snow. The yard is entirely covered in a thick layer of snow, and there are visible footprints in the snow leading from the bottom of the frame toward the house's entrance. The background consists of bare, winter trees under a clear, bright blue sky. The atmosphere is serene and peaceful, and the mood is calm and possibly cold due to the snow. The overall impression is one of quiet solitude and the beauty of a winter landscape.](https://github.com/Sobieck/memories-of-lisa-rae-mitchell-phd/blob/main/pictures/thomas-anderson-sobieck/2013/WP_000265.jpg?raw=true)

Lisa couldn't drive in the last year or two of her career. She had problems with coordination from her illness. It felt as if there was a disconnect from her brain and her feet and hands. She didn't feel safe driving.

So I would drop her off and pick her up at work during that time. It was just part of Zoe dog's and my life to be driving back and forth. 

So we got a pretty big winter storm one day, it hit right in the middle of the work day. Lisa had a patient that she wanted to see. So I drove her in and decided to stay at the clinic in the MU Hospital while Lisa saw this patient. The roads were pretty much clear when we were driving in but it started coming down hard pretty soon. 

Her office didn't have windows so she couldn't see it coming down. I fucking hate driving on snow in, especially in Missouri, because people drive like idiots. So I kept on calling her and calling her, but she was in with a patient so she wasn't picking up her phone. I think this must have been an evaluation, because she was with the person for like 3 hours and I was progressively getting more freaked out.

We eventually went home, but I couldn't see the roads and it was completely fresh snow. No one was out. We did make it home, but I really didn't have a fun time that day.
