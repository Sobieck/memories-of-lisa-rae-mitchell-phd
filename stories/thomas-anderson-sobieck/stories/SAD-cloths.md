Lisa loved her things. She loved her cloths and shoes. She loved things that were soft and made her comfortable. 

The year before she got super sick she bought a whole new wardrobe of expensive and super comfortable sweaters. They were made of cashmere and the like. Just super soft and pretty. So she just loved them. 

After she entered the room her body changed. I think that time she gained weight so all the new cloths wouldn't fit anymore and she was so distraught that she wouldn't be able to wear those cloths anymore. I didn't understand it because she was living in a god damned pitch black room 24/7. But she was just so sad that she wouldn't ever be able to wear those things again.

I tried to cheer her up by telling her we'd do a Pretty Woman thing and go buy everything in her favorite store when she got better. I don't think this helped in the moment but we ended up doing that eventual.
