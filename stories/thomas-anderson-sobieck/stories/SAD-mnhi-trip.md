In 2019 Lisa arranged a trip to the Michigan Headache clinic in Ann Arbor. This place had a really good reputation. Lisa arranged the whole trip. She talked to the nurses and they said she sounded like she would make a great candidate for their inpatient clinic. I arranged the actual travel and I worked while there. 

We were both so hopeful that Lisa would get some help. She was doing good for her at that time, but she really wanted her life back. 

So we went and met with the doctor. Lisa even hugged her after they talked because she was so hopeful. The psychologist also said that Lisa was doing well for what she was dealing with. 

But after a day the clinic called us and told us that her case was too complex for them and she would have to see local specialists for her care (which we'd already been doing). Needless to say this was devastating. So we woke up the next morning and just drove all the way home. By the time we got home it was dark and Lisa put something over her face to protect herself from headlights (this was the last time she was driving out at night). 

But we got home to our cold dark house. We sat her in her chair (which we'd brought to Michigan) in the den and I had to work in the dark to feed her and do everything we needed to do to get her to bed. I just remember how crushing it was and how depressing everything was. 

It was just so sad. She just wanted help and no one could/would do that for her. She was obviously very pissed that we traveled all that way and the nurses told her they'd be able to help just for us to be sent home right away. 

That was the last over night trip she made.
