I used to get Lisa up at eight am. I’d brush my teeth and clean up the kitchen a bit and then Gidget and I would go get her up. 

I’d come in the room and say good morning and tell her about how excited I was to see her (this was genuine). I’d pick up around her bed. She used tons of Kleenex during the night doing what? I don’t know. I’d also clean up her dried edamame which would make a big mess. Then I’d help her get out of bed by holding the sheets and keeping her hat on the right side of her head until she was ready to take it. 

I’d then flush her commode and typically have to plunge it because she also used a ton of tp. I’d wash my hands and by that point Lisa would probably be done with all of her morning things (putting in nose drops and the like). 

She would then greet Gidget at the end of the bed and tell her how much she loved her and all that. Gidget adored this part of the day. She would do headstands while making her happy mumbling noises. 

I’d then go downstairs and prepare her breakfast, fruit, etc. Lisa would call me when she was at the bottom of the stairs (this would take a while) and then she would use my arm to brace herself for the last step. I’d always tell her she was being like my bird of prey landing on my arm. 

She’d then step into her sandals with the Velcro and I would Velcro her in and she’d go walk to her chair while I went upstairs to make her bed and the like.
