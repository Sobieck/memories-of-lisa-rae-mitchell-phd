Lisa believed to her core that "Proper Planning and Preparation Prevents Piss Poor Performance." Even before she was sick she'd always be writing notes thinking about what she was going to do, say, etc. He mom was telling me the other day about how she thought that it was funny that Lisa basically had a plan about what they were going to talk about. 

When she was sick this tendency became more extreme. For instance, she'd write copious notes and then rehearse with me listening before doctors appointments.  

She was even taking notes at the end there for little things. Things like the air temp at x time and how many seconds her water and food needed to go into the microwave.

When she lost her ability to look at paper she'd have me put together pages and pages of notes for doctors appointments. Her mind was incredible. Even though she hadn't seen the notes, she remembered exactly where she told me to put x fact or story. 

Eventually, this became too much for me and Robyn started to take the notes. I was so thankful for that. It was eating up so much of my time helping her plan, especially when I thought it wasn't productive. She always performed very well for doctors even in emergencies without preparation. But I think she needed to feel like she was in control since she'd lost so much control over her own life. 

In the end, I think this tendency killed her. Her last doctor wanted very detailed notes about Lisa's life. This, combined with this OCD like need to take notes just drove Lisa to a new extreme of exhaustion where she lost touch with reality. I remember telling her to think of her life like a beach. She was trying to describe her life in the detail of each grain of sand, which is impossible and just too detailed. She needed to describe her life and illness in the detail of the dunes. 

It breaks my heart. She desperately wanted to get better and have a life with me.
