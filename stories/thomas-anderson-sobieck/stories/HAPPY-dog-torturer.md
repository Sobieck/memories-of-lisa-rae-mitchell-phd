Zoe dog had long hair and allergies so she needed a lot of care. Lisa was in charge of that sort of thing. She'd bathe Zoe weekly. Zoe hated it. I'd tell Lisa that she was in the running for dog torturer of the year every time she'd do one of those things because Zoe was so miserable when it was happening. But Zoe dog would get the post torture zoomies every time so her and I would just run around the house at top speed together. Zoe really loved that time and it would always make Lisa laugh to watch us run around acting like idiots. 

![Lisa, a woman with shoulder-length light brown hair, wearing glasses and a patterned cloth face mask, sitting on a light beige rug. She is dressed in a white bathrobe over pink pajama pants with white stars. Her feet are clad in fuzzy pink slippers. She is grooming a small, fluffy black and white dog, Zoe. A significant amount of the dog's clipped fur is scattered around the dog and on the rug. A silver electric grooming tool is partially visible near the dog. In the background, a dark brown floor is visible, along with a portion of a dark wooden table, a wicker basket containing some items, and a potted plant with long, green leaves. The overall mood is one of casual domesticity, perhaps slightly messy due to the grooming process. The atmosphere is calm and quiet; it feels like a normal, everyday scene in a home setting.](https://github.com/Sobieck/memories-of-lisa-rae-mitchell-phd/blob/main/pictures/thomas-anderson-sobieck/2014/WP_20140308_001.jpg?raw=true)
