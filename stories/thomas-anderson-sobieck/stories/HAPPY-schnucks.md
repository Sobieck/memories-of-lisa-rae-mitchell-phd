Lisa and I basically only shopped for groceries at Schnuck's for the whole of our relationship. Schnuck's is a St. Louis chain and it has pretty good stuff. We got used to going there because it was just one block over from our first apartment. We'd get on our bikes after work and go over there to get some food and bring it home to cook up. 

Later when we lived further away we'd also go together to go grocery shopping. I don't know why, I think we just like the experience of picking out food together. My last job gave us Friday afternoons off. So we'd go to Schnucks during that time. I'd get there and the first thing I do would to lift my arms over my head and say "its the weekend" relatively loudly and waddle a little quicker than normal and then give her a hug (when that was still possible). Then she would concentrate on getting the ingredients for the delicious food she would cook us for the week while I wandered here and there looking at snacks and the like. I would do anything to have some times like that with her again.
