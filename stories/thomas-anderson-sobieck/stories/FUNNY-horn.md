This happened during spring of 18, 19, or 20. Don’t remember which. 

While I was working Lisa would spend a lot of time outside. The vast majority of the time it was on the front porch. But occasionally she’d want to spend it on the back deck. Shed set up one of our high chairs and rest her feet on the decks guard rails. 

She would just sit out there and bliss out. Maybe she’d do a little reading but a lot of the time she was just taking in the sounds and sights. 

And on this particular day she got to take in the sounds of some horn player practicing across the valley. They just went on and on and on. And Lisa was just so frustrated. She just wanted to hear the natural sounds and relax. And this person who wasn’t particularly talented (and playing a bad instrument imo) was just fucking it up. I think Lisa gave up being out there after that because the horn player would practice pretty much daily.
