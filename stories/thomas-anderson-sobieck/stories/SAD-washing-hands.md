At the end of Lisa's life she didn't wash her hands all that often. She used tons of hand sanitizer (this isn't a good substitute for hand washing everyone. It doesn't work for pathogens that follow the fecal-oral route. So wash your hands after using the restroom please). She stopped washing her hands as much as she should because she became so sensitive to hot and cold. So the water would have to be perfect temp for her to be comfortable. 

So she'd go poop at the same time every day in the evening. And she'd wash her hands after it and also use her bathing wipes and brush her teeth. But while she was washing her hands I would be sitting in the den with Gidget reading and I would just hear her making very loud noises as she tested the water over and over again trying to get it perfect. "Damn" "Ouch!" "AH" "NO" etc etc. It was comical if it wasn't so sad. I asked her once, doesn't it hurt your head to yell in that little bathroom and she said "of course, but it is completely involuntary" but she kept on washing her hands anytime she defecated. I'm just saying that it is so weird but it also shows that she was pretty tough to do something that caused her tons of pain simple because she had to.
