when i was working, I'd spend hours after work just scratching lisa's back and legs. It would calm her pain down. She always loved the sensation of scratching. I think these times brought her a lot of joy. I would just be sitting there scratching her while reading the internet. I remember reading that RBG died while I was doing this. I also would scratch her on the arm 10 years ago at the start of the really bad times to help her get to sleep. I'd lay there in her room while she listened to Mike and Molly and scratch her until she was ready to drift off to sleep. (this anecdote might be jumbled up a bit, it was so long ago that I might have mixed up periods).

I started growing nails recently and I thought about how nice it would be for her to have nails scratching her. But we didn't touch at all at the end there. I had to help her move a few days before she died, which was the first time I touched her in years. And then I gave her a few hours before she killed herself.
