Lisa would always tell me that our life around 2014 was her favorite period. She was very sick but not so sick that it destroyed her ability to enjoy things. We couldn't do most things that normal people do, but we've always loved the little things. She also just loved that we were together all the time. She'd do her things and I'd do mine, but we could interact with each other any time we wanted. She would always talk longingly at the end of her life about just wanting to be able to lay down and read or watch tv. The last 5 or so years of her life she laying down just hurt unless it was for bed, and then she'd lay down in a way that was uncomfortable for her. She was a tummy sleeper during her healthy period of her life (we bonded over this as I am also a tummy sleeper), but only sleeping on her back was doable by the end. 

2015 wasn't as great for her because I got a job in an office and she missed me and our pup, Zoe, died.
