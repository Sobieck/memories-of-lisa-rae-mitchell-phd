Very very very early in our relationship Lisa got sick so she had to cancel some plans. I think that this was early enough that we weren't even really a couple yet. So I offered to bring her over some food to help her feel better. 

I brought over some home made chicken soup. I think I used a rotisserie chicken and some fancy egg noodles. I'm pretty sure I had mushrooms and the like in it as well. But I brought it over to her little apartment and we ate it on the floor in her den. I think that is the moment she really started to love me, or at least there be the possibility of loving me. 

She raved about how good the soup was, and would always talk about it for the rest of her life. Basically every chicken soup she had for the rest of her life didn't measure up to that bowl. 

It is also funny that me taking care of her was so foundational to our early relationship. I never would have guessed that I would spend years trying to help her feel better. I wish that the chicken soup episode hadn't been foreshadowing. It would have been nice to have a long normal life with her. I miss her.
