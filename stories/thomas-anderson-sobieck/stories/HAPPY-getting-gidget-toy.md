Right after we got Gidget we figured we needed to get her some toys and a harness for walking. So we brought her over to treats unleashed and got her a little pink harness which was very fetching on her. But the main memory I have of this day is Lisa and me walking around the store asking the clerk what she thought Gidget would like. The clerk recommended these little red balls that look like raspberries. I was still miserable because I take death pretty hard. Zoe dog had just died a month or so ago and I was still in mourning. But Lisa decided that we just needed to get another dog, so we adopted Gidget and it was one of the best decisions of my life. 

After this I would go outside in the back yard every day after work and train Gidget to play fetch, which she caught onto pretty quickly and it became her second favorite thing behind eating. 

She fucking loves those balls. She will chew on them some, play fetch with them, and when she gets really happy she will just go find one and pounce on it. She tends to pill up the balls on her beds so she is like a dragon sleeping on her hoard.

![The image features Gidget, a small, fluffy dog sitting on a bed. She is predominantly light tan or cream-colored, with slightly longer, somewhat unkempt fur. Its nose is a pinkish, and its eyes are dark and sleepy. Gidget is a chihuahua mix. Its paws are visible, resting on the bedding. The dog is situated on a blue quilt. The quilt has a distinct pattern of white stylized leaves or floral shapes on a light blue background. The pattern is fairly consistent across the visible portion of the quilt Partially visible under the edge of the quilt is a red rubber toy, which resembles a raspberry in shape and color. A portion of a book or other item with a cream-colored cover is visible at the bottom right of the frame. Part of a small, dark-colored toy, a stuffed frog, is visible near the bottom center of the image. In the background, a portion of a light-colored wall is visible, along with a framed picture of what appears to be a beach scene, a partially visible door, and a glimpse of a tablet or laptop computer resting on the bed. This suggests the scene is taking place inside a bedroom or home setting. The overall atmosphere is calm and peaceful. The lighting is soft and natural, giving a gentle and homely feel to the image. The mood is one of quiet observation, with the emphasis on the dog's presence and the comfortable, relaxed setting.](https://github.com/Sobieck/memories-of-lisa-rae-mitchell-phd/blob/main/pictures/thomas-anderson-sobieck/2015/20150903_162432.jpg?raw=true")
