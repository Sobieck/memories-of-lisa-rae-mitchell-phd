For a couple years we made an enormous amount of Christmas cookies. The first year we made them while listening to very loud Christmas music and I think we made some every weekend from thanksgiving until Christmas. Lisa did a lot of the work that year and it was so fun. 

She ended up making little gift plates for all of our neighbors. Robyn was telling me that she remembered that Lisa forgot to tell the neighbors that some of the cookies required refrigeration so I had to go tell everyone not to eat those cookies. That was our first time really making friends with the people around us. 

The next year Lisa couldn’t help. She watched and directed as me and her parents made the cookies. I don’t think she could handle the music either at that point :(. 

And I think the next year I tried to get her to participate. But it was just too much for her.
