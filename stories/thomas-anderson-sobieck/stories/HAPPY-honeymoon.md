We flew out to Aus on Christmas eve for our honeymoon. The boarding crew learned we were on our honeymoon some how and upgraded us to business class. The flight from LA to Melbourne was empty. We were offered champagne when we got on the plane, and normally I would jump on that offer. I loved champagne. But we both decided we were going to sleep on that flight. So Lisa gave me one of her ambiens (the only time I've ever taken an Rx that wasn't mine) and we both blissfully slept for a lot of that long ass flight. I was nice because I normally don't sleep on planes at all. 

We went to our Hotel which was on the beach. The very first thing we did was go out and sit on the beach in a fucking jet lagged daze. It was awful. But then we got a nice meal. Melbourne was great. I remember one pizza place were I ate pizza with Lisa and then decided I was going to eat a dozen oysters. 

We'd go out to brekkie every morning to the various Cafes around the hotel and Lisa would get flat whites (something she was very excited about given her australian roots). I also remember her being excited to introduce me to an Australian salad sandwich at a random restaurant. 

We went to a bunch of places that Tony Bourdain went to in his episode of No Reservations, they were pretty good. But the one that he liked the most was closed for that time of year (christmas and ny) which seems pretty odd, but I guess it is the height of summer there. 

While in Melbourne we went to see the aquarium. That was the only aquarium visit of our marriage. But I specifically remember how we both loved looking at the penguins. 

We didn't reserve anything for NYE and apparently that was a mistake. So I think we ended up getting dressed up to walk around, and then ate instant noods in the hotel room. 

Lisa wanted a beach view, so we changed our room. I lost my very nice swiss watch, nice sun glasses, and very nice dress shoes in that switch over.

We also made the very ill advised decision to walk to Queens park. I don't know what my foot ware was but Lisa didn't wear the appropriate shoes. She was really struggling by the time we made it. It must have been like a 30 minute walk. 

After Melbourne we went to meet Robyn's parents. They were so pleased to have us. We spent a lot of time talking in their little apartment. But we also went to Freemantle, a beach town. We went into galleries, went to see the beach, saw the prison, etc. We had fish and chips and the docks in the WORST fucking heat ever. It was really great. On that trip we all got ice cream as well. 

They took us to Queens park and we ate at a nice restaurant there and went to the top of the clock tower. I'm very happy that we decided to go see them. It was great that Lisa was able to introduce me to them. It was also very special to her that she was able to see them before they both died. She always talked about how it was too bad I wasn't able to meet her aunt, but they had a falling out before we traveled there. She said that family was very fun to be around. 

Then we flew out to Sydney for the last couple days of the trip. Her parents got us a room looking at the Opera House at the Shangra La. There was a uniformed driver to pick us up at the airport and the accommodations were just phenomenal. We ended up seeing her fathers family. We went on a ferry ride to see the sites. The most memorable part for me was meeting her Uncle Bob at the very very nice seafood buffet at the hotel. Uncle Bob and I talked about all sorts of shit. We both have very eclectic interests. I remember talking about nuclear power with him. We basically ignored the whole table. I talked to Lisa about how much I enjoyed that conversation for years afterward.

The funny thing about the honeymoon is that we didn't have sex the whole 2 week (?) trip. I think something about being jet lagged as shit doesn't put one in the mood. I always thought that was odd given that sex is like the defining characteristic of honeymoons in our culture. But we'd be living together for a while before we were married. So I guess sex wasn't new to us, and we were both very happy just experiencing new things together. I miss her. 

The trip home was grueling. It took forever! The ride home in the bus from STL was terrible and super super super late. The first person had no one on his bus, but we hadn't got our luggage and that asshole left us. And it took hours for the next bus to come. It was the college football championship I think and that guy needed to get home to watch it. But it was a terrible end to the trip. Lisa swore that she'd make a stop in LA first before flying home next time. 

I guess this story also reveals how deeply Lisa loved her family and her Australian roots. She probably would have been better served with a traditional honeymoon to an island in the caribbean (somewhere she desperately wanted to visit but never got to) but instead she opted to take the grueling trip to see her family and show me Australian culture. Well now I'm crying again. Fuck this life man.
