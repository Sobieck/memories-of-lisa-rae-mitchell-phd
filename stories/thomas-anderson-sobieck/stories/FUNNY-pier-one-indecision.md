Lisa was in the market for some new piece of furniture to store her tea collection. And we’d go to pier one maybe every other week when Lisa was in the mood for decorating. 

So we were there one day and found a really nice piece with a heavy slate table section. It had display area underneath and then glass cabinets up top. 

It was marketed as clearance so it was a no return item. But Lisa liked it enough that we got it. After work one day I borrowed someone’s truck and brought it home. Given Lisa’s various disabilities, she couldn’t help me move it and given my inability to ask for help I simply moved it myself. I’m sure I used a dolly or something but that sucker is heavy. 

Lisa started having second thoughts about it. There was another piece she liked so she asked me to return it. I said 1. It is non refundable and 2. It is heavy as shit and I just moved it. 

So we came to a compromise, she’d get a different one (mango wood) for the dining room and I would use this other thing in my office.
