Lisa FUCKING loved decorating.

One of the things that Lisa loved to decorate with was fake flowers. Some of the more expensive fake flowers nowadays are really realistic. So Lisa would put these flowers in the massive number of vases she had, but the flowers needed to be trimmed. So she used a very long handled tree branch cutter on them. The flowers are generally metal cored so our poor trimmer is now serrated because it bent the blades so bad.
