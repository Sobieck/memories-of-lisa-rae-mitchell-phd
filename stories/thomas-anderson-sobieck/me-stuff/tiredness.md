I was listening to a podcast this morning on my run. It was Dan Carlin and he had a guy on and they were discussing the reality of war, specifically as an American on the front lines in the Pacific in WWII. 

The dude was describing how the Japanese were really good at terrorizing the allies at night. They'd sneak up on the allies and do ambushes when the allied soldiers would prefer to be sleeping. 

They were talking about how the allied soldiers would be so tired. That they just needed a break but they couldn't do anything but push through. 

That is basically how I've felt for the past several years. I was so tired I just felt like I would collapse. But Lisa and Gidget needed me, so I just had to get up and do what needed doing. It was an awful feeling. But it was just a fraction of what Lisa was going through. So I did it every day without complaint. Ok, you are right. I complained a lot about needing a weekend or vacation.

But it was an awful experience. It really is terrible to feel like you need to be on top of everything every minute of the day. But I'm happy that I was able to make Lisa as comfortable as I was able. I wish I could have done more.
