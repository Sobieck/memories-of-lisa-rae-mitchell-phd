I'm only going to keep a single box of her stuff that reminds me of her. 

Inventory of momentos:

Wipes Lisa used: Smells like her at the end of her life

Two tea strainers: Tea shit that she loved.

Spoon “condom”: The tape thing I made for her to put over the end of her metal spoons so that she wouldn't have to touch the cold utensil. There were hundreds of things like this I did. Like covering up the little lights on various appliances. I remember traveling with tape so I could cover up the little red lights in hotel rooms. 

Boggle, inside boggle is some stationary that Lisa made right after she retired: we played so much boggle for 2018ish until late 2020. And shortly after she retired she wanted to have something to do so we went to michael's to look for crafts. Lisa bought some greeting card kits where you could put together your own cards. She did this happily for like two days and then said "now what?" and we laughed because we spent all that money for something she did just a little. She ended up spending her relatively healthy retirement watching TV, cooking, cleaning, walking, and just taking it easy. This was so good for her. She would always say that was her happiest period of her life. We spent a month in Florida during this time that she just loved. 

Lisa’s hat: she wore these constantly in the last years of her life. 

The Thomas Keller cookbooks: Lisa love it when I cooked from these. I think I made her the fried chicken for her birthday, but we had it maybe monthly. And she LOVED the ice creams. Caramel and Mint Choco chip she loved.

A few cooks illustrated cook books. We used them a lot. I got the ones with a lot of vegetarian meals

Zoe Dog's ashes: obvious

Recipe rating folder: We'd rate each others cooking on a 1-10 and save the recipes in this binder. So we could easily remember the ones we liked.

Pop up card: I used to get her these greatings cards that were pop ups. I'd just give them to her randomly when she was feeling not well. The one I have here is one I apparently didn't even write in but I addressed it to "LUB" in my terrible handwriting. 

Lisa liked her buddha statues. I got two of them. One is normal and the other is of an elephant.

Lisa’s phone with tape on it. She’d use it to call me all the time to help her in the last years of her life. It has tape on it so the screen wouldn’t hurt her. 

Graduation picture with ray and Robyn. I took this picture. It is when we were first dating and the first time I met her parents. 

Lisa Gidget and me picture from after the second room stay and before the last terrible period of her life. 

Picture of her grandparents 

Business card holder I think she bought me at poppy when we were first dating. It is nice wood and well made. I think it might have been one of the first gifts she gave me

One of the last cards she wrote me. We used to give each other greeting cards a lot. This one addresses me as lovey and it has a chih on it. It is from 2020 and it is lamenting that we can’t do something special for my birthday. 

And apron with cupcakes on it. She was wearing this one night when I got home from work with nothing but it on and high heels I think while cooking dinner. This was unusual to say the least and I just turned around and walked back outside. We did what one does in a situation like that when I came back in (ate dinner like normal and not have sex)

Goddess statue: pink fat goddess statue. I’m vaguely recalling her having this before we met. But I don’t know it’s provenance

Brown leather journal: Lisa got it for me? We recorded her symptoms in it at some point 

2018-2019 planners: Lisa recorded her life in these. She would write about all the things she was doing and whatnot. She loved them. We got them at Office Depot one day. I think we had a fight that day about something minor. But we went into Office Depot and found this type for her that worked with all her limitations. 

Lisa’s and my boggle pads: has her handwriting on it

Bluetooth remote: she used this to control the volume of her tv shows on an iPad when she was doing that in 2021-22. She would increase the volume back and forth to try to avoid a headache. 

Pulse oximeter: for a few years Lisa’s heartbeat would go wild and she would have all sort of anxiety about it. We had the oximeter to show her that she was in normal range and her o2 was good. 

Sushi rolling pad: when I first met Lisa she loved making veggie sushi. She made it all the time for me. She also made me lots of bean tacos with hard shells that she fried herself. 

Popper: part of English tradition is to use these poppers on Christmas. They have little hats in them and Lisa loved them. 

Picture of Lisa and her friends when she was very young.
