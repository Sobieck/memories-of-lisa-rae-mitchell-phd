I'm only going to keep a single box of her stuff that reminds me of her. 

Inventory of momentos:

Wipes Lisa used: Smells like her at the end of her life

Two tea strainers: Tea shit that she loved.

Spoon “condom”: The tape thing I made for her to put over the end of her metal spoons so that she wouldn't have to touch the cold utensil. There were hundreds of things like this I did. Like covering up the little lights on various appliances. I remember traveling with tape so I could cover up the little red lights in hotel rooms. 

Boggle, inside boggle is some stationary that Lisa made right after she retired: we played so much boggle for 2018ish until late 2020. And shortly after she retired she wanted to have something to do so we went to michael's to look for crafts. Lisa bought some greeting card kits where you could put together your own cards. She did this happily for like two days and then said "now what?" and we laughed because we spent all that money for something she did just a little. She ended up spending her relatively healthy retirement watching TV, cooking, cleaning, walking, and just taking it easy. This was so good for her. She would always say that was her happiest period of her life. We spent a month in Florida during this time that she just loved. 

Lisa’s hat: she wore these constantly in the last years of her life. 

The Thomas Keller cookbooks: Lisa love it when I cooked from these. I think I made her the fried chicken for her birthday, but we had it maybe monthly. And she LOVED the ice creams. Caramel and Mint Choco chip she loved.

A few cooks illustrated cook books. We used them a lot. I got the ones with a lot of vegetarian meals

Zoe Dog's ashes: obvious

Recipe rating folder: We'd rate each others cooking on a 1-10 and save the recipes in this binder. So we could easily remember the ones we liked.

Pop up card: I used to get her these greatings cards that were pop ups. I'd just give them to her randomly when she was feeling not well. The one I have here is one I apparently didn't even write in but I addressed it to "LUB" in my terrible handwriting. 

Lisa liked her buddha statues. I got two of them. One is normal and the other is of an elephant.
