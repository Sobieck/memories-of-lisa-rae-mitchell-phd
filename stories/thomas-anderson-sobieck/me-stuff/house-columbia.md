I’m going to grieve for six month or so before making a final decision, but I have way too many bad memories of this house and town. 

I remember being so happy to move into this house. It is perfect. Large for two people, nice location, close to the trail, our back abuts a part, and it has amazing views. I remember telling Lisa that this was our last home and we’ll never leave.
