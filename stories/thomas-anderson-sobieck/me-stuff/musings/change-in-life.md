I was prepared to take care of Lisa for the rest of my life. I think it would have killed me very early because it was so stressful and hard to watch the person I loved most suffer so. But I was fully anticipating that I would take care of her and I'd do my fucking best to make sure she was comfortable. 

This change has been so fucking weird. Suddenly, Lisa is no longer in my life at all, and I'm _bored_ of all things. I was never bored for years and years because I didn't have time to be bored. It is just bizarre. 

A friend of mine was telling me that they thought that what I did for Lisa was extreme, that basically no one would go to the lengths I did to make her comfortable. I'm not sure about that, but even if it is true, I still prefer the time I was caring for her to this time. I just miss her so much. 

I think I come out of the experience transformed. Before it I always knew that I had a strong sense of right and wrong. Taking care of her was the right thing to do. Trying to bring her bits of joy in her miserable existence was important. But I come out of this knowing that I'm the sort of person that will stick with someone to the end even if it is extraordinarily hard.

I will continue to live and try to build a new life for myself. I hope I never forget how wonderful she was. I know that she would want me to have a good life.
