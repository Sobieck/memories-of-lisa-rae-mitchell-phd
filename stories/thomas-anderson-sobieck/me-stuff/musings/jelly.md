I think I'm a bit jealous of the people who knew Lisa before she came to Columbia. I only got to know her before she got so sick for like six years? Something like that. 2/3rds of our relationship were with us always worrying about her health. I just wish we had more carefree times together. 

With that said, I did get to see her far more than anyone else in the last 10 years of her life. And we had incredibly fun times even during that period (for us, I'm sure most normal people would be bored). Even the bad times I will always cherish. I even miss helping her with her wounds. I always tried to make it easy on her by making jokes and whatnot. 

She was my lovey and I am glad I got to spend time with her and help when I could. I just wish we had it a bit easier.
