Talking to a friend about my Covid fears around going to a concert:

Oh I don't know if want to be in a small venue with a lot of screaming people for a show with Covid still going around. 

1. Taste is extremely important to me and that symptom of Covid freaks me out 

2. Lisa's illness started right after she had a virus. So I have seen what can happen after a relatively minor infection to compare Covid. She basically had long covid I think. 

3. I don't think I've fully comprehended that my risk tolerances are wildly different now. Like I can get sick and it won't harm anyone, whereas before it would have been a massive problem for Lisa
