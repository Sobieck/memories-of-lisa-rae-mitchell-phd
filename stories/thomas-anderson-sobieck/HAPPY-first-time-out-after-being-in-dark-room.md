One thing that going through trauma with someone is that coming out the other end is extraordinary. 

Lisa spent a long time in a dark room. She came out of it on valentines day and we opened christmas presents that day and it was so much fun. It was just so much fun to see her enjoying herself after spending endless months in the dark. I think she was in the dark for a year and a half that time.  

But the best meal I've ever had was IHOP. It was our first outing since her stay in the dark. We went to IHOP. I think she got pancakes and I got chicken and waffles. But I don't think anything will ever taste as fine as that shitty food. I was just so happy to be there with her and seeing her enjoy herself. We both just grew to appreciate the little things. 

Lisa started a habit of just sitting out on the front porch in a swinging bench. She would have her feet up on it with a blanket over her with Gidget dog on top of her. And she would just sit there for hours. She'd come inside to prepare meals and fruit. She'd bring them over to me while I worked. 

I remember one time during a meeting I looked over there (the swing is right out my office window) and commented to my coworkers about how extraordinary it that she was just able to enjoy herself. I think I even teared up a bit because it had such an impact on me. Just little things became so valuable to us and we both grew to love the simple things.

During that period of time we also had little tea parties every morning out on the porch before she'd get to her day of heavy relaxing. Just a fancy table cloth, some of her beautiful collection of tea stuff, and some black tea. We'd read the Stoics while having a cup of black tea and I think cookies.
