During one of the periods where Lisa was doing very well, we would go out to restaurants once a week at off times on the weekend. One weekend we went to Cafe Poland and Ivana knew who we were. She is very good at remembering folk. But so we ordered, Lisa got her favorite, the breakfast hotdog. Which is just a hotdog with bacon and eggs ont he top. It is really good but a bit rich. But Lisa fucking loved them. Every time I went there in subsequent years she would tell me I should get the breakfast hotdog ðŸ˜€. 

But on this particular trip Ivana told us that coffee was on the house. I think I had a little cup, but Lisa had 3. I actually think it might have been the first time she had had coffee in a long time (she was a tea woman at that time). She was bouncing off the god damned walls. I've never seen her more energetic. She told me all about how she wrote her dissertation at coffee shops and a bunch of other things. I remember being shocked about how much she was telling me about things she never really talked about. She really wasn't a person who reminisced very much. It was great. She loved that place. 

But it was definitely one of my favorite things we did. We did the hard drugs (caffeine) and came out the other side together.
