DOCTOR HORROR STORIES

First christmas away from family because she was sick. Eating dove chocolates and just spending all day in the sunny room bed. Dove chocolates to go look at lights with Zoe dog. Just the two of us with no stress whatsoever.

Look from LisaFood repo to find little things to illustrate her life at the end. Menu, caregiver instructions, and the like.

She just kept losing things she loved. Work, laying down during the days, travel, being able to watch tv, be outside, coffee, tea, being able to relax, cook, get me fruit, cleaning, mowing the lawn, gardening, etc etc. Until her life was very small

sounds were bad. People outside couldn't use loud tools in our yard, at the end we had seeding grass out in the back yard because we didn't get it mowed for a couple years.

VARIOUS THINGS I WROTE IN THE COUPLE DAYS AFTER LISA KILLED HERSELF

I’m probably still going to be a bit antsy about going inside without a mask in public. I really don’t want to get sick. Lisa’s whole illness started with a virus and that had made me very cautious with Covid. Maybe get takeout and eat it at the house or something?

And it is dumbfounding to me. She was feeling a bit better lately. I was showing her her tea cups and she was getting joy from it. She played with the pup every day. I decorated for spring because she wanted it. These are small things but it was something she wasn't doing for six months or so.

You don’t realize how meaningful just little things are and how they can bring you joy. Is something she said about looking at her teacups and the spring decor we were putting out in the last couple months of her life

I’m in shock. I wasn’t expecting this. Lisa was suicidal for years. But over the past few years she told me she would never kill herself specifically because she didn’t have a means to do it that was acceptable. So I relaxed and didn’t worry. I think the thing that changed was that she was willing to do something she didn’t want to do because of the danger to me and the dog. 

But I spent a lot of the day yesterday with my in-laws talking about Lisa. I also talked a lot of the phone with all her old friends. I was going to get pirogies but they were closed so I went to Bangkok gardens and one of my old coworkers was working along with the owner. So they made me dinner and hung out with me. My best friend in town here also had me come over to see her for a bit last night. 

So I’m overwhelmed and I feel lost. Being constantly vigilant for years for Lisa to not having anything really is just bizarre. I never would have thought I would miss her yelling at me from the other room constantly for help. But I do and I wish she was still here. She was just so good for me. 

But I’ll survive. I know the cops were worried about my safety and I’m sure other people are as well. But I made a decision a long time ago that I wanted to live my life even if it is hard. 

I’ll probably start asking around for a therapist after a month or two. Lisa would always tell me that I needed to avoid ruminating about trauma until a little time had passed. 

So yeah. Not great but I’ll just put one foot in front of the other.

She’s been seeing a concierge neurologist who is just wonderful. But she saw her every other week for the past month and a half. And the doctor was very interested and wanted all the details of Lisa’s illness. And Lisa’s illness was very complex. So Lisa then spent the last month and a half of her life detailing out her life story to her mom to write down for about an hour at a time each day. I think this just exhausted her to the point where she just lost touch with reality. 

A couple days ago she convinced herself at night that I would get her illness and die if I touched the things she was touching. I was able to get her to calm down and the day before she died she had a good and calm day. I thought we’d turned a corner. But she called me again worried about this that night. So I think she killed herself to protect me and our dog.

But I really appreciate the kind words. I did love her more than anything. I can’t sleep tonight because I’m just thinking about all the wrong things I did and I’m just missing her. It fucking hurts. 

She just was this amazingly compassionate and principled person who won the shittiest lottery possible. I’m super proud that I dedicated myself fully to helping her. But I just wish I could have done more. She didn’t deserve to suffer the way she did.

I’d always be trying to keep Lisa’s spirits up when I was doing things for her. One of the things I’d say after I did some trivial task like adjust the blankets on her feet, would be to say “I fucking did it. All the haters said I couldn’t do it and I did it.” Frequently we’d have discussions about who these haters might be and why they might question my competency to heat up her water for 10 seconds.

Lisa would get super annoyed if I kissed the dog and made kissy noises at her. She’d huff anytime I did it without thinking 






Thank you! I love you lots. And don’t worry about me. I’ve been through a lot and will get through this. I’m just going miss her so much. We were two peas in a pod. 

I just wish she would have had less pain in her life. She was such a wonderful person and she suffered so much
