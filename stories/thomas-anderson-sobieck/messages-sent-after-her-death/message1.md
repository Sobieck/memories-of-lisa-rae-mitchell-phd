I think Lisa's defining feature was kindness and a fierceness of spirit (or something). She was such an amazing person. She was amazingly kind person but she was very bullheaded. She was had a backbone and a strong sense of right and wrong. You couldn't force her to do anything. 

I actually can't recall her face. My brain doesn't think in images and I can't do it.

I didn't worry about suicide for the past few years. She reassured me so much that she would never do it because she was so afraid. I would voice my worried about it to her and she said she'd never do it. She's been very very stressed from seeing a new doctor and I think she lost touch with reality. Over the past couple days she convinced herself, when she was alone at night that I would die if I touched the things she was sleeping on and using. I last talked to her last night at midnight she was telling me this. Much to my shame I actually yelled at her because I'm at my wits end and told her that there was no mechanism for that. That the danger for me is exhaustion so I needed sleep.  I went back into the room very shortly after and apologized and gave her a hug for the first time in years. I told her I'd be here for her forever and that she really didn't need to worry about me. That she just needed rest and this would go away. This wasn't the first time something like this happened so I just thought it would go away. I guess what was different is that she was concerned about me and the pup instead of herself. I think she did it to protect us. 

And things were relatively good. This is something I wrote to another friend:

"The really fucked up thing about this is that I think having her parents here was kind of changing her outlook on life a bit. She had me decorate the house for spring and that brought her a lot of joy. She'd also having me show her one of her tea cups every day and it made her so happy. She told her mom it was remarkable that she could feel something other than pain."

And she was seeing a doctor who thought she knew what was going on. The doctor was taking tons of time with her, so I had hope for the first time in years. 

Anyways, I need to go walk the dog or something.
