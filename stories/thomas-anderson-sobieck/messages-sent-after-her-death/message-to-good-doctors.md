x,

Lisa killed herself a few days ago. 

I just want to thank you for your care. Lisa had a really rough last ten years of her life and many doctors were dismissive or even unkind. But she always knew that you had her back, believed her, and were trying your best to help her. You gave her hope even as her life became more and more awful. 

So, thank you. I'm really glad that she had some people she trusted.
