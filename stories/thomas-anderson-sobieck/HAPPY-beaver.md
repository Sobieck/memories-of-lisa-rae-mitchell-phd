One afternoon after work when Lisa and I were first dating we decided to go on a walk on the trail behind our apartment (the trail that is directly behind our current home). We put some drinks in coffee thermoses, probably wine, but I think they might have been mixed drinks and then we just went out on our walk. It was nice just moseying with each other, and then a storm broke out over us. It was a warm spring day (I think) and we just said fuck lets keep walking even with the downpour and occasional thunder. We were young and newly in love with not a care in the world.

Then we saw something in the distance, an apparition on the trail, and we couldn't figure out what it was. No one was out because of the storm. As we got closer we saw that it was a fucking huge beaver just hanging out on the trail. I think they were just being less shy because it was raining and we were the only people on the trail. I've never seen a beaver again in all my years here, but I do see their dams sometimes.
