Happiest moments:

Tea parties
Collecting tea stuff, after room the first time
Meeting her at Top 10 Wines. Then when we became a thing. 

collecting knick nacks with her at Tuesday Morning and Pier One. We'd go out all the time with Gidget to buy decor and whatnot. 

First retired
    Working on book, table in the sun room - find book
    Laying in bed watching tv all day, south facing room, sun streaming in, Zoe on the bed

Almost 10 years exactly this ending. Zoe died, we got Gidget, had a few months of happiness
    Zoe's memorial internet domain lapsed just a few days ago after 10 years


Birthday Party with whole family at Abigail’s in rocheport.

Mom making me angel food cake, negative

DOCTOR HORROR STORIES

First christmas away from family because she was sick. Eating dove chocolates and just spending all day in the sunny room bed. Dove chocolates to go look at lights with Zoe dog. Just the two of us with no stress whatsoever.

Look from LisaFood repo to find little things to illustrate her life at the end. Menu, caregiver instructions, and the like.

She just kept losing things she loved. Work, laying down during the days, travel, being able to watch tv, be outside, coffee, tea, being able to relax, cook, get me fruit, cleaning, mowing the lawn, gardening, etc etc. Until her life was very small

sounds were bad. People outside couldn't use loud tools in our yard, at the end we had seeding grass out in the back yard because we didn't get it mowed for a couple years. 





























VARIOUS THINGS I WROTE IN THE COUPLE DAYS AFTER LISA KILLED HERSELF

I’m probably still going to be a bit antsy about going inside without a mask in public. I really don’t want to get sick. Lisa’s whole illness started with a virus and that had made me very cautious with Covid. Maybe get takeout and eat it at the house or something?

Hi All. I forgot that a lot of people might want to send flowers. I really appreciate the thought, and if you've already sent them that is great. But I think I'd prefer it if you sent donations in Lisa's name to causes that she held dear to her heart. The first is helping with animals. We got all of our animals from the Central Missouri Humane Society. https://cmhspets.org/ The next is ComoMobileAid.org. They help get resources to homeless folk, and they even help with pets. The third is borderkindness.org. They help keep refugees safe on the border of the US. And, finally, thetrevorproject.org. They run a crisis line for lbgtq+ people.

And it is dumbfounding to me. She was feeling a bit better lately. I was showing her her tea cups and she was getting joy from it. She played with the pup every day. I decorated for spring because she wanted it. These are small things but it was something she wasn't doing for six months or so.

You don’t realize how meaningful just little things are and how they can bring you joy. Is something she said about looking at her teacups and the spring decor we were putting out in the last couple months of her life

I’m in shock. I wasn’t expecting this. Lisa was suicidal for years. But over the past few years she told me she would never kill herself specifically because she didn’t have a means to do it that was acceptable. So I relaxed and didn’t worry. I think the thing that changed was that she was willing to do something she didn’t want to do because of the danger to me and the dog. 

But I spent a lot of the day yesterday with my in-laws talking about Lisa. I also talked a lot of the phone with all her old friends. I was going to get pirogies but they were closed so I went to Bangkok gardens and one of my old coworkers was working along with the owner. So they made me dinner and hung out with me. My best friend in town here also had me come over to see her for a bit last night. 

So I’m overwhelmed and I feel lost. Being constantly vigilant for years for Lisa to not having anything really is just bizarre. I never would have thought I would miss her yelling at me from the other room constantly for help. But I do and I wish she was still here. She was just so good for me. 

But I’ll survive. I know the cops were worried about my safety and I’m sure other people are as well. But I made a decision a long time ago that I wanted to live my life even if it is hard. 

I’ll probably start asking around for a therapist after a month or two. Lisa would always tell me that I needed to avoid ruminating about trauma until a little time had passed. 

So yeah. Not great but I’ll just put one foot in front of the other.

She’s been seeing a concierge neurologist who is just wonderful. But she saw her every other week for the past month and a half. And the doctor was very interested and wanted all the details of Lisa’s illness. And Lisa’s illness was very complex. So Lisa then spent the last month and a half of her life detailing out her life story to her mom to write down for about an hour at a time each day. I think this just exhausted her to the point where she just lost touch with reality. 

A couple days ago she convinced herself at night that I would get her illness and die if I touched the things she was touching. I was able to get her to calm down and the day before she died she had a good and calm day. I thought we’d turned a corner. But she called me again worried about this that night. So I think she killed herself to protect me and our dog.

But I really appreciate the kind words. I did love her more than anything. I can’t sleep tonight because I’m just thinking about all the wrong things I did and I’m just missing her. It fucking hurts. 

She just was this amazingly compassionate and principled person who won the shittiest lottery possible. I’m super proud that I dedicated myself fully to helping her. But I just wish I could have done more. She didn’t deserve to suffer the way she did.

I’d always be trying to keep Lisa’s spirits up when I was doing things for her. One of the things I’d say after I did some trivial task like adjust the blankets on her feet, would be to say “I fucking did it. All the haters said I couldn’t do it and I did it.” Frequently we’d have discussions about who these haters might be and why they might question my competency to heat up her water for 10 seconds.

Lisa would get super annoyed if I kissed the dog and made kissy noises at her. She’d huff anytime I did it without thinking

The really fucked up thing about this is that I think having her parents here was kind of changing her outlook on life a bit. She had me decorate the house for spring and that brought her a lot of joy. She'd also having me show her one of her tea cups every day and it made her so happy. She told her mom it was remarkable that she could feel something other than pain. 

Call me when you are up to it. It is probably good that you can't talk today. I've been on the phone nonstop and I'm very tired. 

I think Lisa's defining feature was kindness and a fierceness of spirit (or something). She was such an amazing person. She was amazingly kind person but she was very bullheaded. She was had a backbone and a strong sense of right and wrong. You couldn't force her to do anything. 

I actually can't recall her face. My brain doesn't think in images and I can't do it.

I didn't worry about suicide for the past few years. She reassured me so much that she would never do it because she was so afraid. I would voice my worried about it to her and she said she'd never do it. She's been very very stressed from seeing a new doctor and I think she lost touch with reality. Over the past couple days she convinced herself, when she was alone at night that I would die if I touched the things she was sleeping on and using. I last talked to her last night at midnight she was telling me this. Much to my shame I actually yelled at her because I'm at my wits end and told her that there was no mechanism for that. That the danger for me is exhaustion so I needed sleep.  I went back into the room very shortly after and apologized and gave her a hug for the first time in years. I told her I'd be here for her forever and that she really didn't need to worry about me. That she just needed rest and this would go away. This wasn't the first time something like this happened so I just thought it would go away. I guess what was different is that she was concerned about me and the pup instead of herself. I think she did it to protect us. 

And things were relatively good. This is something I wrote to another friend:

"The really fucked up thing about this is that I think having her parents here was kind of changing her outlook on life a bit. She had me decorate the house for spring and that brought her a lot of joy. She'd also having me show her one of her tea cups every day and it made her so happy. She told her mom it was remarkable that she could feel something other than pain."

And she was seeing a doctor who thought she knew what was going on. The doctor was taking tons of time with her, so I had hope for the first time in years. 

Anyways, I need to go walk the dog or something. 

Thank you for your letter. Lisa absolutely loved you and would always talk in the most glowing terms about you. I'm pretty sure you were her favorite person other than me and maybe her parents. Thank you for being in her life. I'm so sorry you didn't get to see her or talk to her these past few years. 

Thomas Anderson Sobieck

Thank you! I love you lots. And don’t worry about me. I’ve been through a lot and will get through this. I’m just going miss her so much. We were two peas in a pod. 

I just wish she would have had less pain in her life. She was such a wonderful person and she suffered so much
