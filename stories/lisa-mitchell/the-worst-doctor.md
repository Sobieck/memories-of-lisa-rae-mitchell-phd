EXCERPT FROM THE BOOK LISA WAS WORKING ON. CHECK IT OUT IN LISA'S DOCUMENTS

Then I met my physician and it did not take long for my heart to sink. He waltzed into the room oozing arrogance. He barely made eye contact and mumbled a hello. He glanced at some paperwork he had on me and said, “So you have memory problems”. 

“Well”, I paused, “Not exactly”. 

He looked up at me and stated sharply, “Then what are you doing here? Do you even have a neurological problem?”

“Well, I have had memory problems, but I have other symptoms that are more prominent at this time” and “I think it would be easiest if I walked you through what has happened”.

“Look”, he said, “You may have your way of doing things when you’re doing your job, but this is how I things”. 

He then proceeded to go through a form he had asking me if I had problem with each body system, such as when he said “Lungs.”

I said, “What do you mean?”

He said, “Do you have any problems with your lungs?”

“Oh”, said I, “I have asthma”.

He continued on like this for a while. Let me add that he was short, curt, and seemed irritated throughout most of the experience. When he asked about my educational level and I said I had a Ph.D., he looked up for once, raised his eyebrows and said with surprise in his voice, “Oh”.

At some point he finally realized that his questioning hadn’t really gotten us anywhere and was forced to let me do a little of the talking. However, he quickly interrupted me when I mentioned that I had had some type of flu like sickness the year before. He seemed to decide at that moment that this was the cause of my current problem. When I attempted to discuss the low B12 levels that my former neurologist thought explained the problem, he mockingly dismissed this theory. When I tried to question him based on what I had read on the subject, he cut me off with such force, I felt at that moment that this was all pointless. I became completely passive for the rest of my time with him, no longer asking questions or trying to convey information. It appeared that he had no interest in anything I had to say and wanted to jump to conclusions as quickly as possible and get rid of me. He scoffed at the diagnosis of Cerebral Small Vessel disease that had been given by the ENT and said, “Let’s call it what it is, wrong.”

When I described my dizziness and how it seemed like things were moving when I tried to focus on them, he stated “That’s called nystagmus”. Then he turned to my husband and said in a judgmental tone of voice, “You should have been able to see it”. He did not allow my husband time to answer. This was the moment when Thomas became enraged as well. 

The positive thing that came out of this first meeting was that he did a neurological physical exam and stated he was able to see the nystagmus. I found that little morsel to be wonderfully validating. 

Then I was sent for of course, more tests. I had blood tests, another MRI, and something called…… This involved having electrodes stuck to my skin and then a hot sensation followed. If I did not respond with a normal sweating response this would indicate nerve damage. 

The next day I returned to see the doctor for my follow-up. I must say I was impressed with their efficiency. He was somewhat kinder this time. However, his opening comment was the most horrifying I had heard thus far from a physician. 

He said, “One thing you said yesterday got my attention, you mentioned something about Somatization Disorder and I was under the impression that that was the problem”.

“Excuse me?” I said with disgust. “I guarantee I did not use the term Somatization”. This is a psychiatric diagnosis for those whose medical complaints have no medical basis and are in fact psychological in nature. I said defensively, “Where did you get that idea? Did someone else say that in my records?”

“No” he said. He quickly stated, “It was proved false by the results of the …test which were abnormal. It appears you have nerve damage in your extremities”. He went on to explain that he thinks that the flu like illness I had a year before upset my system to such an extent that it triggered an autoimmune reaction that has caused some nerve damage in my peripheral and central nervous systems. He stated this is basically an educated guess as to the cause of the nerve damage. He stated he thinks it is probable that I will gradually heal. However, he also stated he has no evidence to back that up. 

When my husband and I left his office, we hung our heads and slowly, bedraggedly, shuffled to the hotel shuttle. Neither of us could barely speak we were so discouraged by how he had treated me. He had also given us a vague diagnosis with no treatment. We were left with uncertainty about the future course of my condition. But mostly we felt crushed by his style of interaction. The entire time I was in his presence I felt like a naughty and silly child, not the competent professional that I was. We could not hit the road and get out of Rochester quick enough. We wanted to put it all behind us. This was in stark contrast to my confident plans before the trip that if I encountered an unhelpful doctor, I would request to see another. I think we both felt hopeless and defeated by the mighty Mayo. 

I later received a follow up letter that included his report. Based on the nystagmus and nerve damage he diagnosed “Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorder” and “Oscillopsia”. He did not say anything about these diagnoses in person. When I looked up what oscillopsia is I was thrilled to have something finally that perfectly described my experience. Thus, I must say that a few good things came from the visit. He gave me a diagnosis, the tests and exam revealed something was in fact wrong, and he gave me a new term that fit my bizarre experience. 

After this adventure into the labyrinth of medical diagnostics, I had had enough. I returned to my PCP only to follow-up since she had made the referral. I told her that I was done searching for answers and ready to just focus on self-care and wait and see if his prediction would be correct.
