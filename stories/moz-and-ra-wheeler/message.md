Our fond memories of Lisa.

We remember happy times with Lisa as a baby and toddler in Oz.
We were so disappointed to see them all head to America for Ray’s work but knew that was what they wanted to do.
Lisa, with Rob and Ray would travel back to Oz on regular trips and we were able to see Lisa growing into a lovely young lady.
We thoroughly enjoyed listening to her playing her flute.
Our family are so saddened by Lisa’s passing and send our love to Rob,Ray, Thomas and family.
