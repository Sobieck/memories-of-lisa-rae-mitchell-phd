Memory of Lisa:

Unfortunately, I only met Lisa twice given my geographic place I call home. The first place that I met her was on Mackinac Island when we celebrated Gayle and Chuck’s anniversary. It was obvious how much in  love the two of them were. They were inseparable and were “two peas in a pod”. The second time that I met her was when I was visiting in Columbia and she was the hostess for a tea party. It was a lovely summer day as we sat outside on her porch feasting on tea and goodies. She had such a kind demeanor and was an excellent hostess. The two of them had a love for each other that was quite remarkable. I know that Lisa touched many people’s lives in her professional life; and that these people are filled with gratitude for her kind and caring ways. May she fly with the angels along with Sarah and our many loved ones.  Blessings and prayers, Aunt Linda (Anderson) Lamoreaux
