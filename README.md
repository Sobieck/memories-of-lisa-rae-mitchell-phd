A place to share memories of Lisa Rae Mitchell

Hi All. I forgot that a lot of people might want to send flowers. I really appreciate the thought, and if you've already sent them that is great. But I think I'd prefer it if you sent donations in Lisa's name to causes that she held dear to her heart. 

The first is helping with animals. We got all of our animals from the Central Missouri Humane Society. https://cmhspets.org/ 

The next is ComoMobileAid.org. They help get resources to homeless folk, and they even help with pets. 

The third is borderkindness.org. They help keep refugees safe on the border of the US. 

And, finally, thetrevorproject.org. They run a crisis line for lbgtq+ people.
