My Mom said I was not more sickly than other children. I think I started getting sick more often than others and for longer beginning at age 24. This is when I began my career as a Social Work Case Manager so all the new responsibilities likely played a role. Sorry if I misspoke during our appointment. This is also when I began developing cold sores around my mouth which I have not had since eliminating gluten.

Birth email: I talked to my Mom about my birth. Everything was normal with me - normal color, leg and arm movements, etc. normal. She has no record of the Apgar score but there was no question about my health. Full term pregnancy. They put me on her breast right away after birth. After she was back in her room they brought me in my crib to be beside her bed for a while. Spent two weeks in the hospital which was the norm for the first baby in Australia at that time. I was not breach because I came out head first. The only problem was I was on my back instead of on my tummy so they rotated and delivered me with forceps not suction after 9 hours of labor. A few days after returning home symptoms occurred which the doctor said indicated a fractured tailbone.

Dr. Dyer GAD depression and anger/irritability - discuss I think OCD
Dizzy I think it’s nystagmus tried all anti nausea drugs no problem with nausea now
