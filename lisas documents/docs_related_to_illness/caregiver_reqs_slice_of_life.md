If we got two caregivers we'd do something like 4 days on 3 days off at 10 hours a day.

I'm thinking we'd have the person come here before Lisa wakes up to make the whole Gidget thing work without giving Lisa a headache. I'd like to wake Lisa up in the mornings, but I guess this isn't 100% necessary.

Potentially: here 24h for a few days for me to have a vacation
Time and a half those days. 

### Requirements 

Woman

Nonsmoker - Smell makes Lisa's heat hurt, same with perfumes

Very good bedside manner, calm, reassuring, patience with Lisa's many many small requests

Cooking some easy dishes. Beans, simple split pea soup, etc.

Cleaning, not the whole home but maybe making Lisa's bed occasionally, Lisa's toilets, kitchen area

Dog friendly

Willingness to wear KN-95 masks while in the house, never taking off while in the house
             These will be provided by us

Vaccinated and kept up to date with boosters

Must not come over if ill, we will still pay if this happens            

Help send emails to doctors, schedule doctors appointments, help take Lisa to appointments (once a month, if that)

There are many many thing I do that I'd like to have someone else do eventually. Pill organizing, refilling Rxes, ect.

There is a lot of bending over and moving things around and adjusting her so she isn't in so much pain

Lisa is naked most of the day, so they'd have to be ok with that. She also also doesn't bath. She doesn't smell to me. 

Quiet, loud noises and bright lights give Lisa pain

Must be willing to learn about MCAS
