INTRODUCTION
My illusion of control develops a crack 
Those of us who live in the wealthy Western world tend to live under the assumption that we are securely in control of most of what happens in our lives. We expect to be paid fairly for hard work. We expect to be happy. We expect to be healthy. We get in the car in the morning to drive to work and assume we will get their safely. We assume that our car will not get a flat tire and we become incensed when it does. We expect things to go right. 
After six grueling years in training to become a psychologist and six years working successfully as one, I expected that I would continue doing so for some time. I did not expect to lose my physical health in middle age. But I did.
During Christmas of 2012, I came down with a flu-like illness that included an upper respiratory infection. I was diagnosed with bronchitis in the Urgent Care. I did not recover for about three weeks. However, after the symptoms eased a new symptom emerged, I became chronically dizzy (that was the only word I had for it at the time). The dizziness occurred daily. It tended to come on around midday and picked up strength as the day progressed.  Also, my vision was altered. I could not focus my eyes on one point and it looked as if the world was jiggling. 
Of course this was frightening, even terrifying at the worst moments. The sensation itself was extremely unpleasant; however the worst aspect of it was the uncertainty about what was wrong. Why on earth is this happening and how do I fix it? I was use to being able to accomplish anything I set my mind to. /but this was different. I felt anything but in control. 
I began my search for an answer with my primary care physician. I recall feeling embarrassed and thinking that I sounded crazy when I was trying to describe what was happening. “It feels like there is movement inside my head”, I said. “It also appears like the world is wobbly”. Because of how strange these statements sounded, for the first time in my life I was struck with the fear that my physician might think I was making this up or that it was a psychological problem.  
This thrust me into the shoes of therapy patients I had worked with who suffered from invisible ailments such as chronic pain. They grappled with feeling that their physicians were judging them as malingering or exaggerating possibly for attention or for drugs. They sometimes became embittered about this and dreaded seeking the pain medication they needed. I recall responding with validation of their feelings, both the psychological and physical ones, which is what they needed most from me. I recall how they appreciated hearing the words, “I believe that the pain is real”. I would also encourage them not to personalize insensitive comments and to recognize when they were jumping to conclusions based on past experiences. 
Because of my familiarity with these issues I was surprised to find myself responding similarly when thrust into the shoes of being a patient. On one hand I thought “It is normal to feel this way” because I knew that it was. Yet at the same time I felt somehow that I should know better and not be so affected. Yet the feelings of self-consciousness when trying to convey strange and invisible symptoms were intense. This led me also to begin dreading medical appointments. This was the first of many moments when I realized that I was walking the road I had helped others navigate and would feel humbled as I realized, now from the perspective of personal experience, how very hard it can be. While I knew it intellectually, I didn’t understand it in my guts until I went through it myself.
My PCP was wonderful. She responded with genuine concern and interest. I had recently begun seeing her due to my disgust with the bedside manner of my previous PCP. I was thrilled to have found in her, the most compassionate and warm hearted physician I had ever encountered. I am so thankful she was the one to whom I first brought my new strange symptoms. However, she was unable to give any easy answers. She said that dizziness is a difficult problem to solve because the word can describe many different experiences and also be caused by many different ailments. She warned me that if we tried to tackle it, this would involve a lengthy process. She was certainly right about that. After five specialists and numerous MRIs, CT scans, blood tests, balance testing, and more, I still have only tentative diagnoses. And at the end of my diagnostic saga I found there is no treatment for what is thought to be wrong with me.  
This is a book about what it is like when things go wrong. In particularly it is about what it was like for me when my assumption that I would remain healthy or if I didn’t, that I would find treatment, at least until old age, was shattered. I had to come face to face with, in the words of Ernest Becker, the denial of death, and learn to let go. It is not a book with a victorious conclusion about how I overcame illness and am now cured. Neither is it a book about giving up. It is a book about how I try to hold the tension between fully accepting what is, while also striving to be open to the possibility of healing. 
In this book, I will walk you through what it has been like for me to become sick and stay sick. I will also describe how I have drawn on the wisdom of others who have walked this road before me. Over the years I have found bibliotherapy (self-help reading) to be crucial in helping me cope with several challenges in my life. Then when I became ill, reading books written by others with chronic illness and how they learned to cope has been pivotal in helping me survive thus far. The most life changing work that I’ve encountered is How to Be Sick: A Buddhist Inspired Guide For the Chronically Ill and Their Caregivers by Toni Bernhard. This book alone was likely sufficient to get me through. Also helpful have been Sick and Tired; You don’t Look Sick; and The Chronic Illness Workbook.
I wrote it primarily because chronic illness is a very isolating experience. It often isolates you because you cannot leave your house and engage with the world as you once did. It also isolates you because most of those in your life will not understand what you are going through and this leads to feeling alone. I have seen how group therapy for people with shared conditions is so powerful in that it helps people feel less alone. They frequently have the experiences of saying “You feel that way too?” or “That happened to you too?” I experienced this when I read books by the above authors. In addition to offering useful coping strategies, they helped me feel less alone in my journey. This was like a supply of needed oxygen. It was like water and I was thirsty. And so I felt it was important to do my best to offer up something to others who may by facing the journey as well.
 Additionally, as the process of experiencing illness unfolded, I found myself drawing on both my knowledge and experience of being a psychologist. This included taking therapies I had used with others, particularly those described as the third wave behavioral therapies and applying them to my life. The third wave therapies draw on Eastern Wisdom, particularly mindfulness. They include Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. I found myself naturally taking what I had used with others and trying to apply it to my own life in a way that had never previously seemed so necessary.
Finally, I found that the interactions I had with patients over the years often came to my mind as I navigated my own illness. I found myself identifying more deeply with their experiences than ever before. And sometimes drawing on what I had observed in them to help myself. Therapists often say that they learn from their clients and I found this to be true more than ever now that I am sick. 
So, I would like to thank other writers on chronic illness who have tremendously eased my journey through sharing theirs, those innovative thinkers in the field of psychology who have brought mindfulness into the mix, and all the Veterans with whom I have worked. Sharing in their journey briefly has been one of the greatest honors of my life.

Chapter One
Diagnosis Hunting 
At the beginning of the illness I tried to hold on to control of my life by hunting for a diagnosis. I became fixated on finding a diagnosis, an explanation for what was happening to me. As noted above, I began with the medical field. I assumed that physicians would have the answers. I assumed they could help me. I assumed my symptoms would not only be diagnosed, but also be treated. I deeply trusted the medical community. I think this is because society tends to place physicians on a pedestal as being somehow superhuman. Additionally, some seem to have bought into this and behave as if they have all the answers.  Also, because of the amazing things that medicine has accomplished I did not adequately recognize its limitations at this point. Jon Kabat-Zinn has stated that “We naturally put enormous faith in modern medicine because of its spectacular success. But at the same time we are often surprisingly uninformed about what medicine does not know and what it cannot do. Often we don’t discover the very real limits of medicine until it is our own body that is in pain or dealing with a particular disease, disorder, or diagnosis, or when someone we love is suffering and there is no ready-made effective solution or treatment”. He also stated “When you come right down to it, there are few medical cures at present or on the horizon for the chronic diseases and other chronic conditions although they are a major cause of suffering, disability, and death in our society”. 
My problems actually began in the summer of 2012. I decided to stop taking the antidepressant Paxil. I began taking the drug during my second year of graduate school after the devastating end to a long-term relationship. I found that the medication also helped me cope with my graduate school stress and my anxiety over my accumulating student loan debt. So I continued to take it. This was before the time when concern over the safety of SSRIs became public. At that time the drug companies still had these issues under wraps. SSRIs were presented by my doctor and also in the psychopharmacological class I took as if they were an extremely safe way to go with no cause for concern.  By the time I decided I no longer needed it my life was extremely stable relationally, financially, and professionally. I had normal work related stress; however this seemed minor and manageable. Overall, life was sweet. So, I decided to come off the Paxil. 
Being responsible, I went to my prescribing primary care physician and asked for her guidance as I knew from my professional work that it was not wise to immediately stop an SSRI. I had never taken more than 10 mg which is the minimum dosage. Thus, I thought this would be relatively easy as long as I tapered down. The doctor told me to cut down by a quarter of a pill at a time, weekly. With her plan I would be Paxil free within a month. Within two days after the first reduction, I began to experience severe withdrawals. I felt as if my brain was tingling. There were little zap-like sensations. I began to feel extremely agitated and overwhelmed. I became irrational and irritable. In that state I could not possible have gone to work and so I immediately went back on my regular dose. 
I went back to my physician and explained what had happened. She appeared to become agitated and stated that it didn’t surprise her because Paxil is a terrible drug. This frightened me. She then told me with total insensitivity, impatience, and what appeared to be irritability that getting off SSRIs was like ripping off a bandaid. You couldn’t avoid the discomfort and just needed to get it over with quickly.  I told her I had read some articles indicating it was good to slowly taper off Paxil and she became more abrasive. She did not like me questioning her. She stated she would prescribe me Effexor, another antidepressant, to help me get off the Paxil. I told her that I had tried Effexor once in the past and had an extremely negative reaction to it. I recall that it made my heart race and my skin feel like it was crawling. She said I probably just had too high a dose and prescribed it anyway. 
I left her office feeling alone and brow-beaten. I was already in a vulnerable state when I went to her for help. I felt much worse after leaving her office. I now felt discouraged and somehow ashamed. I knew this was not how someone should feel after seeing this physician and vowed to never see her again. IO had also lost all confidence in her abilities to address my problem because I was quite certain that getting off Paxil should not be equated with ripping off a band-aid. At that point I felt I was on my own and read a book about how to safely get off antidepressants written by a Harvard psychiatrist who specializes in this area, entitled……. Dr. states that the key to getting off SSRIs is by taking it a slow as necessary and adjusting the tapering plan based on the individual. He states that there is a large range of difference between how sensitive people are to the withdrawals. He stated that there are some individuals, although few, who will not be able to get off them at all due to the severity of withdrawal. I also read that that the AMA has stated that 10% of individuals will not be able to get off SSRIs due to the severity of withdrawals. 
Based on Dr, …..recommendations I began a much slower taper using the liquid form of Paxil, which can be done in much smaller reductions. Even doing the smallest reductions possible, I experienced significant withdrawals that did not stop over time. After three months of doing this I got the flu-like illness mentioned above. While discouraged from being sick and also realizing at this tapering pace it would take me years to get off the drug, I gave up and went back on the 10 mg. My body recovered from the illness after three weeks; however this is also when the dizziness began. 
This is the point when I began seeing a new PCP who had a vastly superior bedside manner, and began the process of trying to determine what was wrong. At my suggestion, I was first sent to psychiatry. I had never seen one before and wondered if they might have some better wisdom to offer about the role Paxil or Paxil withdrawal may be playing in my new chronic dizziness. I was seen by a nurse practitioner who said she really doubted the Paxil had anything to do with the problem and thought it was likely medical in nature. Just to confirm this, she briefly consulted with a psychiatrist in the hallway. He then came in and sat down. When I explained about the severe withdrawals and the slow taper he stated with a mocking tone and chortle, “Who gave you that advice?” I could tell by his arrogant interpersonal style that there was no point in explain a Harvard psychiatrist told me. The psychiatrist also stated that he did not believe the withdrawals were that bad and that “You were probably so anxious about discontinuing the Paxil that you over-reacted”. In other words, he was telling me that I imagined the severity of the withdrawal due to my own anxiety. “Asshole”, I thought. What I said was that in fact I thought I had no more need for the drug and that getting off of it would be no big deal as long as I tapered. I stated that I was caught by surprise by the physical symptoms as they were very unexpected. He snorted and said that his recommendation was that I double my Paxil prescription from 10 to 20 mg. When he left the room, the nurse practitioner, who I was much more impressed with, seemed somewhat embarrassed and said, “Well that wasn’t very helpful, was it?”
I decided to give it a try, hoping that somehow increasing my Paxil would help. I thought maybe this would level things out somehow. However, I knew that I was sensitive to medication (10 mg is a tiny dose and worked for me) and so the nurse practitioner and I agreed I would gradually increase to 15 mg. I know that when I have begun Paxil I have the common side effects that go along with starting the medication quite strongly. So, I took a vacation from work in order to see how my body responded. 
The first week of the increase I had a horrific migraine headache daily. They were so severe my usual medication, Maxalt, did not take them away. By the end of the week my dizziness increased ten-fold and I felt I was continuously on a merry-go round. Everything was spinning. I went back to my regular dose of Paxil and went back to my primary care physician. I told her the psychiatric nurse practitioner said she thought it was likely that the problem was medical and that I should see an ENT. So I was referred.      
The ENT I saw was at a University Hospital and was recognized for being top in his field. However, he gave me the wrong diagnosis, twice. Without performing any testing he told me that he thought I likely had an inner ear imbalance problem that was causing my dizziness and prescribed a diuretic so that I would excrete water and balance would be returned. Even though I had warned him that I was allergic to sulfa drugs, he gave me a sulfa drug and said that it was different and would not cause an allergic reaction. Well, it did. I broke out in a rash all over my legs shortly after taking it. After this he said, “Well I guess we better do some testing and see if that is the problem before we continue”. 
I was then sent for the most horrendous medical experience of my life. I was sent to an expert in balance testing. One procedure involved shooting hot and then cold air into my ears. This was designed to trigger a dizzy response. If I became dizzy they would know I likely did not have a tumor or something that was hindering a normal dizziness reaction. Well, good news, no tumor! I experienced dizziness beyond my wildest imagination. It was horrific. I became so nauseous the examiner had to wait for long periods of time before continuing the testing. I felt like a torture victim. When the results came they were disappointing because they were….  normal. As I came to learn, in those with invisible illnesses, normal results commonly trigger mixed feelings. On one hand I felt relieved they did not find something terribly wrong and on the other hand normal test results provide no answers and further contributed to feelings of invalidation. 
Next, I was sent for an MRI. I knew patients were often uncomfortable with this procedure due to being in a confined space. Some have to be sedated. However, I did not expect that it would bother me. I was surprised to find how unnerving it is to realize that you are in a situation where you are in a TINY space, must lie still and cannot escape without requesting assistance. It feels coffin like. I figured out quickly it is best to keep your eyes closed. Then the banging began. I did not realize MRIs are LOUD! It sounds as if you are in a metal box and someone is banging on it with a hammer. This goes on for about 45 minutes. The noise combined with the cramped feeling is a lovely recipe for panic. I have a new respect for the fear people have associated with this procedure. I found the concept of “letting go” to be helpful as it is for me during airplane turbulence and gynecological procedures. The more you tense and fight the worse it is. These situations involve a loss of control. If you can surrender your control, it is much better. This is what kept me from panicking. This also reminds me of a strategy used in ACT to illustrate how struggling with things that are uncontrollable can make things worse. It is the Chinese finger trap….describe . However, for some, letting go of control can feel impossible. In particular, for combat Veterans, it might have been being hypervigilent that they believe kept them alive during war. Thus, surrendering one’s control feels too much like letting down one’s guard and this feels life threatening. Thus, Veterans with PTSD tend to have difficulty with MRIs. 
The MRI revealed “Small white matter lesions” in my brain. This was diagnosed by the radiologist who examined it as likely being the result of Cerebral Small Vessel Disease. My brain was not getting enough oxygen. The ENT relayed this information and stated with glorious certainty to me that this was my diagnosis. I was also informed that this could lead to a slow decline in memory and the condition increased my risk for dementia and stroke. “What?!” I was 38 years old when I was told this. The doctor delivered the news bluntly as if he was telling me that I had a hangnail. He was uninterested in discussing it further. I asked if diet or exercise would help change the outcome and he said flippantly, “No”. He prescribed me a medication that he confidently said would fix me in three months. Naturally, I believed him.  My husband and I left his office that day feeling exuberant. Problem solved!
Given the doctor’s pitifully brief explanation and my need to understand, I began researching the condition on the internet. What I read wasn’t pretty. It sounded horribly depressing and hopeless. I could find nothing in the literature about the medication he prescribed being a treatment for my condition. I also read that this was a condition common to the elderly and those who smoked or had diabetes. I was only 38, I don’t smoke, and I don’t have diabetes. I thought this was odd and was curious why I would have developed it. 
Initially when I took the medication I began feeling better. I was again exuberant! I was fixed! This was the first of many gleeful moments when I would think I had finally found a cure and life would get back to normal. Unfortunately, this set me up for a massive plunge into disappointment when the improvement would be short lived. As time went on my symptoms actually worsened and by the end of the three months I was by far at the worst point I have experienced with my condition. I became extremely fatigued. The kind of fatigue that one experiences with the flu. The kind where you feel like you have been run over by a truck or like there is a piano on top of you. It is different than the type of fatigue the healthy experience at 3pm in the afternoon when they need a little caffeine pick me up. Or the fatigue you feel at the end of a hard day at work. This kind of fatigue brings you to your knees and makes you beg for mercy. You have to respect this kind of fatigue. There is no pushing through it. It becomes the dictator of how you spend your time.
I also began having cognitive disturbance. I had difficulty concentrating, remembering, and processing incoming information. My husband would ask me simple questions and it would seem to me that he had asked me to solve a calculus problem. This was the most frightening of all that had happened thus far because I truly believed that I was dementing and I made my living by thinking.
Up until this point I had been getting by at work. I often had to leave early because the symptoms worsened as the day progressed and so I had by this time used up all my sick and vacation leave. I had kept my supervisor informed all along about the dizziness. However, when my condition took this nose dive and I was out of leave, I contacted my workplace supervisor to discuss what to do next. It was so uncomfortable for me to admit that things were this bad, to reveal personal medical information, and to acknowledge that I could not perform my job at this time. My supervisor was kind and suggested I file for FMLA. I was somewhat apprehensive about asking my PCP to complete the paperwork, especially given the ENT’s comment that he could work despite his hypertension (again, what a ridiculous thing to say). However, she was happy to assist and stated she was surprised I had been working as much as I had. I then had to deal with Human Resources and this was a hassle that I am choosing not to elaborate on here. The FMLA was approved, so I took off a couple of weeks and the rest helped somewhat. I returned to working on a part time basis in the mornings when I was at my best.  
I returned to my PCP and she agreed with me that the diagnosis did not seem to fit well. I said that since my diagnosis was neurological, maybe I should see a neurologist. She agreed and referred me to one. The neurologist had a kinder bedside manner than the ENT, which I appreciated greatly. She did not seem arrogant as he had. She stated that she had reviewed my notes and it seemed there was some diagnostic confusion. She stated words that were music to my ears, “Start at the beginning and tell me everything”. I walked her through what had occurred thus far and she stated “I disagree with the diagnosis of small vessel disease” and “It is really off base”. She said the radiologist likely made it without considering specifics to me such as age. Being a psychologist I am well aware of how grey our field can be. However, I did not realize to what extent this also applied to medicine. I have since read that it is common for those who fall within the category of ICI to receive many different diagnoses. 
The neurologist said she did not have an answer at this point; however suspected Multiple Sclerosis. She needed to order numerous tests. Here we go again, I thought. She ordered more blood tests, another MRI, evoked potentials testing, and also sent me to see a neuro-ophthalmologist. Of course the neuro-ophthalmologist order more testing. Fortunately none of this was unpleasant. However, again it revealed normal results which yet again made me feel simultaneously both relieved and frustrated. One of my symptoms is that the vision in my left eye periodically becomes blurry. This tends to occur the more fatigued I am. This occurred to a very mild extent during my examination with the neuroopthalim and I told him so. He then had me read an eye chart and it demonstrated I had 20/20 vision. I felt silly and assumed he was thinking, “crazy”.   
When I returned for my follow up with the neurologist she said most of the tests were normal and I likely did not have MS. You may not believe it, but again this news was met with mixed feelings. There comes a point where you feel desperate for a diagnosis, any diagnosis so that you can leave the diagnosis seeking stage. However, overall I felt relief as a diagnosis of MS is not something anyone truly wants. However, testing did reveal something. I was deficient in vitamin B6 and very low in vitamin B12. The neurologist was most concerned about the B12 and said that she has seen people with levels higher than mine experiencing neurological problems.  Unlike the ENT, she said this was likely the problem and did not convey certainty. I appreciated her hesitance as it felt honest and realistic. She recommended I begin supplementation. She offered no guidance on the amount of supplementation and I did not think to ask.
At this point I had some experience with false hope and did not get overly excited about the B12. Naturally, I began reading about the topic and was surprised to learn how vital vitamin B12 is for our neurological functioning and for nearly all of our body systems. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause nerve damage and if left untreated for long enough, it can cause demylination of the neurons in the brain. This means that the part of the neuron that aides in conduction of messages between brain cells erodes and cannot grow back. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause: fatigue, poor balance, dizziness, vision disturbance and cognitive disturbance (cite Could it Be B12).  
However, I did find that within a few weeks the cognitive symptoms disappeared and I regained some of my energy. The dizziness improved slightly. Being able to think clearly again was a tremendous relief. When I returned to see the neurologist she said she expected continued gradual improvement over time. Hallelujah!
At Thanksgiving that year I gave thanks for vitamin B12 and for the doctor who thought to test for it. I had been working only part-time for a few months due to my symptoms (I was fairly functional in the mornings). Since I was improving I increased my work hours. I did this around the time of the holidays when family was in town and I pushed myself to do more than usual socially a well. By the conclusion of the holidays my dizziness and fatigue were worse again. However, the cognitive symptoms did not return. I returned to my PCP and she decided it was time to go to the experts in sorting out diagnostic mysteries, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. 
She had suggested this before; however when you are feeling sick the last thing you want to do is travel. Also, I was sick of dealing with doctors and having tests by this point. To top it off, I would be going to Minnesota in January. Brrrr……   But, I felt I could not say I had done everything I could unless I went. I have not yet mentioned that because of my symptoms, I cannot drive. So my saintly husband drove me to Minnesota in the middle of winter. My husband is a cautious driver in good road conditions. So he especially enjoyed navigating slippery roads with minimal visibility.  
While preparing for my trip, I wrote out what had happened thus far and my questions into a concise bullet format. I did this to try to be helpful to the physicians I would see and because my memory problems sometimes returned when I was especially fatigued. I also thought that if I was going to bother to travel this far and get a hotel for 1-2 weeks as the Mayo Clinic estimated I would need, I was going to make sure I had a chance to ask questions. I assumed this was what was expected since the staff there must understand that people are sacrificing much to get there. 
I had been reading about B12 deficiency and what I read neatly explained everything that had happened thus far. However, sadly, if left untreated for too long, the nerve damage that occurs with B12 deficiency can be permanent. Also what I read indicated there are different recommended dosages and forms of B12. I thus had questions about all this. I thought this very reasonable and was looking forward to having access to experts!
Based on my PCP’s referral I was scheduled to see a neurologist. After reading Osler’s Web about the negative experiences patients with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome had at the Mayo Clinic in the 1980s and recent online comments from patients about their disappointing trips to Mayo, I was somewhat leery. However, I thought that I will never know what they can do for me if I don’t give it a chance. I also thought that just because some patients have had a bad experience, doesn’t mean that I will. I looked over the profile of the physician I would see and felt somewhat apprehensive that I would be seeing an older male. I was concerned about gender bias and that he came from an era before bedside manner was emphasized in medical schools. However, despite these concerns I could not help but muster hope. When we arrived we found that the Mayo Clinic itself is beautiful. It is full of lovely marble and flooded with natural light. I felt like I had arrived at Mecca for the sick. 
Then I met my physician and it did not take long for my heart to sink. He waltzed into the room oozing arrogance. He barely made eye contact and mumbled a hello. He glanced at some paperwork he had on me and said, “So you have memory problems”. 
“Well”, I paused, “Not exactly”. 
He looked up at me and stated sharply, “Then what are you doing here? Do you even have a neurological problem?”
“Well, I have had memory problems, but I have other symptoms that are more prominent at this time” and “I think it would be easiest if I walked you through what has happened”.
“Look”, he said, “You may have your way of doing things when you’re doing your job, but this is how I things”. 
He then proceeded to go through a form he had asking me if I had problem with each body system, such as when he said “Lungs.”
I said, “What do you mean?”
He said, “Do you have any problems with your lungs?”
“Oh”, said I, “I have asthma”.
He continued on like this for a while. Let me add that he was short, curt, and seemed irritated throughout most of the experience. When he asked about my educational level and I said I had a Ph.D., he looked up for once, raised his eyebrows and said with surprise in his voice, “Oh”.
At some point he finally realized that his questioning hadn’t really gotten us anywhere and was forced to let me do a little of the talking. However, he quickly interrupted me when I mentioned that I had had some type of flu like sickness the year before. He seemed to decide at that moment that this was the cause of my current problem. When I attempted to discuss the low B12 levels that my former neurologist thought explained the problem, he mockingly dismissed this theory. When I tried to question him based on what I had read on the subject, he cut me off with such force, I felt at that moment that this was all pointless. I became completely passive for the rest of my time with him, no longer asking questions or trying to convey information. It appeared that he had no interest in anything I had to say and wanted to jump to conclusions as quickly as possible and get rid of me. He scoffed at the diagnosis of Cerebral Small Vessel disease that had been given by the ENT and said, “Let’s call it what it is, wrong.”
When I described my dizziness and how it seemed like things were moving when I tried to focus on them, he stated “That’s called nystagmus”. Then he turned to my husband and said in a judgmental tone of voice, “You should have been able to see it”. He did not allow my husband time to answer. This was the moment when Thomas became enraged as well. 
The positive thing that came out of this first meeting was that he did a neurological physical exam and stated he was able to see the nystagmus. I found that little morsel to be wonderfully validating. 
Then I was sent for of course, more tests. I had blood tests, another MRI, and something called…… This involved having electrodes stuck to my skin and then a hot sensation followed. If I did not respond with a normal sweating response this would indicate nerve damage. 
The next day I returned to see the doctor for my follow-up. I must say I was impressed with their efficiency. He was somewhat kinder this time. However, his opening comment was the most horrifying I had heard thus far from a physician. 
He said, “One thing you said yesterday got my attention, you mentioned something about Somatization Disorder and I was under the impression that that was the problem”.
“Excuse me?” I said with disgust. “I guarantee I did not use the term Somatization”. This is a psychiatric diagnosis for those whose medical complaints have no medical basis and are in fact psychological in nature. I said defensively, “Where did you get that idea? Did someone else say that in my records?”
“No” he said. He quickly stated, “It was proved false by the results of the …test which were abnormal. It appears you have nerve damage in your extremities”. He went on to explain that he thinks that the flu like illness I had a year before upset my system to such an extent that it triggered an autoimmune reaction that has caused some nerve damage in my peripheral and central nervous systems. He stated this is basically an educated guess as to the cause of the nerve damage. He stated he thinks it is probable that I will gradually heal. However, he also stated he has no evidence to back that up. 
When my husband and I left his office, we hung our heads and slowly, bedraggedly, shuffled to the hotel shuttle. Neither of us could barely speak we were so discouraged by how he had treated me. He had also given us a vague diagnosis with no treatment. We were left with uncertainty about the future course of my condition. But mostly we felt crushed by his style of interaction. The entire time I was in his presence I felt like a naughty and silly child, not the competent professional that I was. We could not hit the road and get out of Rochester quick enough. We wanted to put it all behind us. This was in stark contrast to my confident plans before the trip that if I encountered an unhelpful doctor, I would request to see another. I think we both felt hopeless and defeated by the mighty Mayo. 
I later received a follow up letter that included his report. Based on the nystagmus and nerve damage he diagnosed “Central and Peripheral Nervous System Disorder” and “Oscillopsia”. He did not say anything about these diagnoses in person. When I looked up what oscillopsia is I was thrilled to have something finally that perfectly described my experience. Thus, I must say that a few good things came from the visit. He gave me a diagnosis, the tests and exam revealed something was in fact wrong, and he gave me a new term that fit my bizarre experience. 
After this adventure into the labyrinth of medical diagnostics, I had had enough. I returned to my PCP only to follow-up since she had made the referral. I told her that I was done searching for answers and ready to just focus on self-care and wait and see if his prediction would be correct.

Chapter Two
Time To Stop Digging
Introduce Mindfulness/MBCT/aCT/dBT in this chapter.
After not getting immediate answers from doctors and after months rolled by without spontaneously getting better, I began to see my illness as possibly being chronic in nature. So, I began to seek comfort and guidance from books on the topic of coping with chronic illness. This turned out to be a highly productive use of my time. I read about others with similar stories which helped me to feel less alone. I also began to get some perspective about what the medical field had to offer and about how my own approach to my sickness might not be helpful. 
I read a book entitled, “You Don’t Look Sick!” which is co-authored by a patient with chronic illness and her physician. The physician, Dr. Overman, is a rheumatologist who specializes in treating chronic conditions. Dr. Overman, states that “the primary focus of modern Western medicine has been to identify acute illnesses and treat them with acute interventions such as surgery or antibiotics. Although Western doctors can take justifiable pride in our advanced abilities to offer the high-tech quick fix, our system has yet to catch up with other countries in meeting the needs of persons with chronic conditions”. So I began to recognize that the medical field and medical research has not been focused on addressing problems like mine. 
I also read the book “Sick and Tired of Feeling Sick and Tired” and learned that many chronic illnesses tend to be invisible to others and this can make diagnosis difficult. Their book focuses on coping with what they call invisible chronic illness. Before reading it I assumed there would be some test out there that would clearly identify my problem. However, I learned that symptoms like mine, which are primarily dizziness and fatigue, fall into the category of symptoms that make doctors groan. This is because they are common to many conditions and not readily observable or measurable. I also learned that others with invisible illness had similar experiences looking for help from the medical community. That is, seeing numerous specialists, being given numerous tests which often reveal nothing, and being left without answers or getting diagnosed with conditions that do not have a good treatment. So, as I read about all this I began to understand the complex nature of my situation and how I was different from a patient who presents with easily diagnosable conditions like high blood pressure or diabetes. I also learned that I was not alone and this was comforting.
Early on in the illness, I felt impatient when I did not get immediate answers from doctors. So I sought control via other means. I began doing my own research. Given the small amount of time we have with our doctors, the time between appointments, and the terror associated with both uncertainty and with new and unfamiliar symptoms and diagnoses, many of us turn to the internet in an attempt to calm ourselves with information. It is difficult to sit passively with uncertainty. However, this act has the opposite effect. I became obsessed with trying to learn everything I could about my problem and self-diagnose. I researched the topic of dizziness relentlessly. I felt I could not rest until I had gotten to the bottom of it and had my laptop open to various medical websites continuously.  This only made me more and more anxious and caught up in a struggle with my symptoms. It also began to worry and irritate my husband.
In “Sick and Tired of Feeling Sick and Tired”, a book about invisible chronic illness, Donoghue and Siegel describe this common desperate search for a diagnosis and discuss that often none is ever found. They also discuss how some with invisible chronic illness become so focused on getting a diagnosis that it can prolong their distress and harm their relationships as they become singularly focused. The authors described one woman who drove her family nuts with her obsession with finding a diagnosis. This struck a chord with me as I recognized myself in the woman obsessed with finding a diagnosis. I also gradually realized that I may never know what is wrong with me.  Because I was reading books written by people who were findings ways to live satisfying lives in spite of illness, I began to consider that I may not need a diagnosis to move forward with my life and that it might be okay if I remain sick. 
One man they interviewed stated that he wished he had spent less time looking for a diagnosis and more time focusing on learning to live well with his symptoms and care for himself. Through reading such wisdom I realized that I needed to switch gears and focus more on living with my symptoms. This was a major turning point for me. It was when I first began to loosen my tight grip around solution seeking and let go a little of my feeble attempt at control. This helped to open the door a bit and allow acceptance to begin creeping in. What sweet relief it brought.
Then I discovered the wonderful book by Toni Bernhard, entitled, How to Be Sick: A Buddhist Inspired Guide for the Chronically Ill and Their Caregivers. The three quotes I provide below were gathered by Toni from her studies of Buddhism. They completely changed the course of my response to my situation. They gently shook me and opened me up to a new relationship to what was happening to me. The first is a quote from the Zen teacher Charlotte Joko Beck, “Our life is always all right. There’s nothing wrong with it. Even if we have horrendous problems, it’s just our life.” Whoa, I thought. 
The next quote Toni gathered from a talk she heard made by Thai Forest monk Ajahn Jumnian on the topic of equanimity. This is the Buddhist practice of seeking calm amidst life’s storms, “When people say, “Ajahn, let’s go for a beautiful walk,” fine I’ll go. If they don’t ask, that’s fine too. I don’t expect a walk to be any more satisfying than sitting alone. It could be hot or windy out there. If people bring me delicious food, great. If they don’t, great. I need to diet anyway. If I’m feeling good, that’s okay. If I’m sick, that’s okay too. It’s a great excuse to lie down.” Well, that is certainly a different spin on things.
Another quote about equanimity Toni provides comes from another Thai Forest monk, Ajahn Chah. In his book A Still Forest Pool, “If you let go a little, you will have a little peace. If you let go a lot, you will have a lot of peace. If you let go completely, you will know complete peace and freedom. Your struggles with the world will have come to an end.” Aaaaaaaaaah…….
After reading these Buddhist comments about a different way of responding to problems and suffering, I was deeply moved. I realized that it was okay that I got sick and it is ok if I stay sick. Also, it might benefit me to loosen the reigns and to stop trying so hard to control what was happening, such as through chasing a diagnosis. I felt the weight of the world lift off of my shoulders as I let these statements seep into my consciousness. 
Let me add that accepting things as being okay and letting go of some control is not the same thing as giving up. I continued to do what I could to pursue an answer. I read these comments before going to the Mayo Clinic and chose to go just in case they found something. However, I no longer desperately needed them to find something. And after I returned from the Mayo Clinic, having gone to the place people go as a final resort, I felt comfortable discontinuing my quest for a diagnosis with medical doctors. My primary care physician said, we can try a different specialist, and I responded with a sense of peacefulness that no, I had seen enough doctors. My highly interpersonally skilled physician immediately saw what was going on and stated, “You just want to be for awhile”. Yes, I just wanted to be for awhile. 
Some metaphors I encountered in my readings about chronic illness and that I had used with others as a therapist, helped me make the transition and begin letting go of my quest for answers. Dr. Overman discusses how many patients he sees have been functioning as if they are in a ditch and spinning their tires. They………..
This reminded me of a metaphor used in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy to illustrate what happens when people try to control difficult thoughts and feelings, which are actually not something within our control. Our attempts to control them, often through avoidance strategies, only serves to make them stronger. The metaphor is that of a person in a hole trying to dig their way out with a shovel. Of course this just causes them to get deeper and deeper entrenched. Instead, the best solution is to drop the shovel. I began to realize that I needed to stop spinning my tires and stop digging when it came to finding an explanation for my condition. By getting so caught up finding an answer, I was struggling in an unproductive and actually destructive way. I needed to learn to sit with uncertainty. 
Another concept I found helpful came from Toni Bernhard’s book “How to Be Sick”. It is a concept that comes from Zen Buddhism that involves using a “Don’t know mind” attitude. There are times in life when we overanalyze, get too focused on finding logical explanations for things. At times it is better to shrug your shoulders and admit, “I just don’t know and that is okay”. When I began embracing this attitude, I felt a tremendous release of tension and mental strain. This was a wonderful and liberating experience. I have now learned to adopt this attitude much more in life and find it is often useful. It is particular helpful when I find myself trying to wrestle with things that are unknowable or not worth the effort. For example, I don’t spend as much time with unproductive thoughts such as “Why did so and so do that?” or “What does my future hold?” or “What if I had made different choices in the past?”
This is also liberating when it comes to the self-blame that often accompanies chronic illness. In our attempts to control our situation, we sometimes relentlessly try to sort out if something we did caused the illness or if the small choices we make each day in living our lives are somehow worsening the symptoms. For example, I find myself thinking “If I had never taken Paxil would I be in this mess” or “If I had not gone to Christmas with family that year (when I caught the virus) would I be sick now?” or “If I had chosen a less stressful career would I be sick?” These are all unknowable and pointlessly blaming of myself for making supposedly wrong choices and causing my current predicament. This is not helpful. We cannot control the past, so why worry about it. We also often cannot know what would have happened if we made different choices. So, just drop the shovel. 
In terms of the small daily choices we make in how to manage our symptoms while living our life, it is tempting to second guess ourselves when there is a flare up of symptoms. What did I do yesterday that caused this? Did I eat the wrong thing? Did I over-exert? Of course these kinds of questions can be helpful up to a point, to get an overall understanding of what your limits are and what works and what doesn’t work. But one can become obsessive about it, beat up on oneself, or sometimes be wrestling with unknowables. I often cannot pinpoint what I did differently when I have a flare up. So, there is something to be said for doing your best and then letting the chips fall where they may. Now when I hae a flare up, I will do a brief check in with my recent choices to see if there is something to be learned and then I drop it and move on with my day. 
Another key tip I discovered that related to this part of my struggle came from Toni Bernhard. In “How to Be Sick” she discussing the Buddhist concept of equanimity which involves finding a sense of calm in the face of life’s turbulence. She suggests practicing “Patient endurance”….   This reminded me of what I had often told Veterans waiting for disability claims to be resolved, that they would need both patience and persistence. The process does not go quickly and presents numerous obstacles along the way. They must learn to both wait at times and also to push at times. Similarly, I had to learn to both sit patiently with diagnostic uncertainty without getting too caught up in trying to force answers, while simultaneously not entirely giving up. This helped me in the times in between medical appointments and also helped me to persist when it was time to go to the Mayo Clinic.  
Mindfulness – doing mode; analyzing vs sensing (MBCT)
ACT – generating stories; drop the shovel
Discuss theme of letting go of control – dropping the rope in every section, “I had to drop the rope”
Also discuss DBT – must both let go and stay open to new possibilities for healing. 
Workability vs truth, postmodern, constructionist, pragmatic, third wave behavioral theories, what works, what doesn’t work, I want to know the truth of what is causing my sickness, but as of yet, I don’t know for sure, so I have to go with what is workable, acct


Chapter Three
Validate me please! 
Dealing with others
The books I found on coping with chronic illness are mostly written by patients who have been through it themselves. I noticed similar topics emerge including the difficulty in finding a diagnosis. Another common topic is dealing with the attitude of others including the medical community, friends, family, and coworkers. 
Doctors:
Another definite downside of becoming sick is having to frequently deal with the medical community. Sometimes you are lucky and encounter a kind and interpersonally skilled physician. More often I have encountered doctors who make me uncomfortable, either due to arrogant or patronizing behavior, coldness, or profoundly poor listening skills. Yet the patient is stuck because she/he needs to find out if there is something wrong that can be treated and physicians hold the keys. Becoming a patient and interfacing with the medical field is something that profoundly shakes one’s feelings of being in control. 
Each book that I read described incidences of horrible encounters with insensitive physicians. In “You Don’t Look Sick”, Joy Selak describes an unpleasant encounter with a physician. He was dismissive of her reports of the side effects of medication she was experiencing. Then when she asked some challenging questions including asking him for the evidence to support his conclusions by asking “How do you know for sure?” The physician responded “Because, young lady, I’m the doctor. That’s how I know.” To protect herself from this sort of thing, Joy uses a three strikes you’re out policy. If a doctor offends her three times, she leaves and does not return to them. 
In Sick and Tired of Feeling Sick and Tired, Donoghue and Siegel provide a quote when discussing consulting a doctor, “When you’re cold don’t expect sympathy from someone who’s warm” – Albert Solzhenitsyn. This made me think of an encounter I had with an ENT. While discussing whether he thought I could continue working while dizzy, he stated curtly, “I have hypertension and it doesn’t stop me from working”. What? How does hypertension impact daily functioning? How can it compare to have difficulty focusing your eyes to read or feeling as if you will fall over when standing? 
Donoghue and Siegel include a description by a psychologist with CFS of how he was made to feel like “a schoolboy before the headmaster” during a doctor’s visit. He stated that the physician “ignored my observation that the fatigue and pain seemed more intense on hot and humid days and waved away a thought I had after reading an article in a medical journal regarding the disease” (22%). I too recall noticing how strange it was to be used to being the professional and being treated with respect for my knowledge and skill in my working life. Then as the patient in the doctor’s office, I would often feel like a little girl trying to prove I am a grown up and know what I am talking about regarding my symptoms.
Donoghue and Siegel provide numerous other specific examples from patients they interviewed about how their interactions with physicians left then feeling invalidated and humiliated. They state that “Physicians, unfortunately, are not always endowed with the insight and patience to respond to the myriad of immeasurable symptoms usually endemic to ICI (invisible chronic illness)”. They discuss how vulnerable patients feel by the time they arrive at the doctor’s office. Yet, they state that medical school trains physicians to “focus onto the scientific examination of data- and the data that he too frequently ignores are the feelings and needs of the patient”.  
In How to Be Sick, Toni Berhnard described how she came to realize she was being treated by doctors as if she was a “hot-potato”. They would initially make bold statements about how they would cure her and then seemed to lose interest by the second meeting. One physician asked her to keep meticulous records of her symptoms, which she did, and then never read them. Specialist would invariably pass her on to another doctor. 
While I was in graduate school for psychology, I had several friends who were going through medical internships and then residency. I recall that one of them was extremely sick with some type flu/cold. He was congested, coughing, sneezing, exhausted, and nearly delirious with sickness. After returning from back to back shifts I suggested that he call in sick instead of returning for his next shift. He refused and showed me the printout of his schedule. There was a note on the bottom which said something along the lines of “do not call in sick unless you are hospitalized and intubated or dead.” He slept for 8 hours then returned for another shift, spreading all his germs to his poor patients. Not to mention his diminished thinking capacity. Another friend was training to be a surgeon. He bragged about how he could go for 8-12 hours without urinating while performing surgery. He once became so dehydrated after having a stomach flu that he had to be hooked up to IV fluids after passing out in his shower. He then dragged the IV around the hospital while doing rounds. When I questioned the wisdom of these behaviors he stated that he wanted to be part of a profession that requires you to push your body to the extreme so that he could feel superior to others. 
I relay these stories because I think they say something about the nature of medical training and thus the way physicians think when they enter the field. I am thankful that the two individuals I described went into Emergency Medicine and not internal medical or family practice. They have brief and time limited exposure to patients. However, is there not something disturbing and eschew about people with this type of mentality being the ones to whom you take your vulnerable self when you are sick?  When what those with chronic invisible illnesses need so desperately is compassion and validation, we are exposed to people taught to think like the above examples? This is troubling to me. 
I once had a negative encounter with a supervisor early on in my training. His way of dealing with me made me feel small and stupid. I discussed this with a highly regarded psychologist who stated that the problem was not me but that I had encountered a narcissist who was in a position of power over me. The psychologist encouraged me to consider the narcissists agenda and then I would have a more accurate picture of the situation. Narcissists see others as objects, not human beings. Others are pawns in their play. They are right and if others disagree they are wrong. The psychologist encouraged me to not take my supervisors behavior personally.
I wonder how many physicians have a narcissistic streak, how much narcissists are drawn to the field for the power, and how much medical schools indoctrinate it. One of my friends described above stated that he recalls in the first few weeks of medical school being told repeatedly how superior they all were to average people. They were being ingrained with a sense of superiority. The reasoning for this was supposedly to prepare them for handling being put into the position of making life and death decisions. However, as I have stated above, it is not comforting as a patient to know the individual who enters the examining room to view you sitting there naked and cold, is coming from this type of perspective. 
I must say that all physicians are not this way. As I have stated, my primary care physician is kind, open, and a good listener. Once when I had been waiting for a considerable time in a slightly cold waiting room, she came in and realized what had occurred. She apologized for making me wait and then she went and got a blanket and wrapped me up in it while we discussed while I was there. This experience nearly blew me away. I had never encountered such sensitivity or kindness in an examination room before. I was nearly dumbstruck. On the day when I had to tell her I did not think I could work anymore and asked her to complete disability paperwork, she began reading it over and then stopped. She leaned back in her chair and looked at me. She then said, “Wow, this must be so difficult for you” and “How are you coping with all this?” She stated that she recognized all I must have gone through to get to the position I was in as a professional woman and what it must mean to acknowledge I had to walk away from it all. She said she hoped I would be able to find a way to continue using my skills to help people. She became slightly tearful and said she was sorry I was going through it. She hugged me. She then filled out the paperwork. In other words, she empathized with me and validated what I was going through. “Wow” is right.  
In addition to poor bedside manner, patients with invisible chronic illnesses may encounter something else from their physicians that makes them feel even worse.  Donoghue and Siegel state that if a doctor cannot solve your problem, he/she may jump to the conclusion that it is psychological. Doctors may do this to cope with their own feelings of inadequacy. The authors refer to a book, “The Missing Diagnosis” by physician C. Orian Truss, “the labeling of the undiagnosed as hypochondriacs has…..:. Dr. Ellen Idler warns about this….. (16%). 
Osler’s Web by journalist, Hillary Johnson documents the initial identification of chronic fatigue syndrome by physicians in the field in the mid-1980s and the chilling battle they went through with government officials such as within the CDC in their attempt to get the disease recognized and studied. The physicians encountered numerous patients who had previously been successful individuals and whose lives had been devastated by getting sick with a mysterious condition. When they were sent to places such as the Mayo Clinic, NIH, and studies by the CDC, they were written off as being mentally ill. However, the book notes that the majority of those who became sick had no psychiatric problems or they had become depressed in response to being so sick that they had lost their careers etc. 
In the early days 1980s many people suffering from the condition sought help at the Mayo Clinic. Johnson writes that at the Mayo Clinic patient imagine “their body’s mysteries and betrayals would be fathomed”. In their 1984 newsletter, the Health Letter, the Mayo Clinic wrote that many people who came reporting fatigue had their tests come back normal. It was written that these people either “have and emotional problem” or “a prolonged reaction to stress”. It was also noted that the Mayo’s standard protocol for these patients was psychiatric treatment. Johnson also wrote that “as an institution the Mayo had much to gain from the epidemic and its victims. Assumptions about the origin of the patient’s symptoms might be made within hours of this or her entry through the imposing marble portals of the vast institution, but it was the clinic’s practice to send these patients on a round of specialist consultations. As the days passed, the patient’s bill burgeoned. Despite the expense, victims of the disease were unlikely to be afforded even compassion”. Patients were eventually “shuttled to the department of psychiatry, the Mayo’s elephant graveyard for those presumed to be psychosomatically ill”.  She describes how after much sacrifice and expense to get there, patients with CFS were commonly told primarily to exercise, “a potentially dangerous recommendation for such patients”. One patient stated, “Everything is black or white for them. There can’t be anything in the world they don’t understand-because they understand everything! They don’t believe in their patients- they believe in their orthodoxy. They read their printouts, but they never really listen to what you’re saying. It’s the world of modern medicine.”
Some of the Mayo doctors were interviewed in 1988 about the disease and their methods of evaluating it. By the time this was ready for publication in 1995 the doctor’s declined to have their names or quotes used. 
During his first visit to the Mayo Clinic, one patient, a young, former bank vice president who became sick with CFS, was told his problem was related to being a Type A person and that he needed to slow down. The banker believed this and quit his job and spent his days gardening. His condition did not improve. He was later talked into returning to the Mayo Clinic. This second time he was told he was primarily depressed and that his depression was due to feelings of inadequacy. Another told him that his problem related to deconditioning and that he needed to exercise more. The patient reported that he left Mayo feeling defeated. He stated, “To feel so sick- to have all these symptoms- and yet to have all these tests come back either normal, or not significantly abnormal. I finally thought, I really must be crazy”.   
The patients had similar experiences within other medical settings. One woman with CFS who also was anxious, was sent to a neurologist. Because she was noticeably anxious the neurologist did not even properly examine her before dismissing her severe sickness as being psychological in nature.  The physician who sent her and was familiar with her case stated that the neurologist did not even conduct a mental status exam. 
Several patients identified by the Cheney and Peterson as having obvious observable organic problems were sent to the NIH for help. One woman with “unidentified bright objects in her brain, cognition problems, immune system abnormalities, devastating physical weakness, and unusual-looking rashes that came and went mysteriously was diagnosed with depression. Another who also had the unidentified bright objects in her brain, abnormal mental status tests, and an active human B-cell lymphotrophic virus infection, was diagnosed only with psychiatric issues at the NIH. As these two were both women, the doctors wondered if there was a gender bias. They sent a male patient, a former attorney, who had brain lesions, a grossly abnormal mental status test, pain in his joints and muscles and overwhelming fatigue. He too was sent back with a psychiatric diagnosis. Specifically, the diagnosis neurasthenia, which is a “quaint Victorian-era code word for mental illness.  (p. 170)
Johnson also describes how researchers at the CDC made jokes about those inflicted with the illness. The individual primarily assigned to researcher the new malady was teased by others about it. Staff wrote a mock letter from CFS patients portraying them in a ridiculous tone as hypochondriacs. The letter began “I am sick…I am so tired, it took me six days to dictate this letter to my secretary.” In response he decorated his cubicle with cartoons poking fun at the people he was supposed to be studying. For example, he had a poster of the Statue of Liberty up on which he had written “Give me your tired, your weak, your EBV-positive, yearning to be diagnosed”. Early on the study of the disease many of those reporting it were found to be positive for the Epstein-Barr virus. He also had a placard up which read “Just because I’m paranoid doesn’t mean they’re not after me.” (p.154) 
Johnson also describes in her book how the CDC eventually had to change their attitude and now list Chronic Fatigue Syndrome as a real medical condition. Dr…… from Davis, a leading CFS researcher says that the patients are owed an apology. 
Fibromyalgia typically thought of as having psychological origins due to no clear organic eviden e of the disease has recently been found to…..
DSM-V definition of somatization…….Looked up book on somatization (mind-body interface) and found that the authors state that about 10% of primary care visits pertain to something with no known organic cause. The authors seem to been presenting this as if this 10% must all be psychosomatic cases. I don’t understand the leap from unidentified medical explanation to psychological cause. Does medicine understand and have the capacity to identify everything that could wrong with the body? consider there to be two types: chrohnic, dependent and independent types who encounter a life crisis. Neither sound like me. 
In Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers, Robert M. Sapolsky writes that when physicians give a diagnosis of “Psychogenic” it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. When “the physician can’t find any disease or organic cause, and until one is discovered, the disorder gets tossed into the psychogenic bucket.This may mean that, legitimately, it is heavily explained by psychological variables, or it may simply mean that the relevant hormone, neurotransmitter, or genetic abnormality has not yet been discovered. Once it is discovered, the psychogenic disease is magically transformed into an organic problem, “Oh it wasn’t your personality after all”. Sapolsky warns, “be skeptical of any current psychogenic label”. I think this can being prematurely dismissed as primarily a psychiatric patient is harmful. It means important organic problems might be overlooked and it feels accusational and invalidating to the patient. It also seems to me that the bar for lumping someone into the “psychogenic” category is very low. If it is the automatic assumption made after no organic explanation easily presents itself, then it seems to me to be premature. It seems that considerable evidence should be gathered before this conclusion is made. My experience at the Mayo Clinic was that the physician jumped to the conclusion that I was somatisizing based on very little evidence. He did not have me psychologically assessed. He did not himself ask me any questions to determine my current psychological functioning. He did not ask me anything about the diagnosis of anxiety that is in my records. If he did I could have told him it is there to justify the continued use of Paxil which I cannot get off because of withdrawal symptoms. He did not comment on the letter written by the psychologist I had seen to assess for any psychological role to my illness. She determined there is none and wrote a letter saying I do not meet the criteria for any psychiatric disorder. 
This is not the same thing as acknowledging that stress may play a role in one’s illness. It makes sense to me that years of accumulated stress, of having cortisol pumping through my body due to the stress of graduate school and financial woes could have worn down my body over time so that I was more susceptible to whatever came along and made me sick in 12/2012. I can also see how the stress of continuing to work while sick hinder my bodies healing resources and prolonged my problem.
Let me say that I suspect the neurologist based his somatization disorder theory on the fact that there is a diagnosis of anxiety in my medical records. I developed problems with anxiety in graduate school primarily due to the distress associated with accumulating massive debt and not earning money over a period of 6 years. Most of my cohort in school developed anxiety about this. I was treated with a very low dose of the medication Paxil, which I have not yet been able to get off due to debilitating withdrawal symptoms when I have tried. As a mental health professional who has worked in a hospital setting, I know that my colleagues are careful about what diagnoses are placed in the patient’s chart. This is because there is a common assumption amongst us that if a patient presents with new medical symptoms to a medical physician and the physician reads that there is a psychiatric diagnosis in the record, there is a tendency for the physician to view the patient with suspicion and dismiss symptoms as being psychological without adequate investigation. 
I think this is what I encountered at the Mayo Clinic. I must add that the neurologist did not ask me about my anxiety and did not assess for current levels of it. Although I was feeling anxious about my new medical symptoms, in general, anxiety has not been a major problem for me for years. It made no sense to me that this would explain my symptoms. I am shocked and appalled to think that he jumped to that conclusion while knowing almost nothing about me. In other words, he started assessing me with a preconceived bias that the problem was all in my head. This is a very convenient way for a physician to pass the blame for being unable to figure out the problem onto the patient. It is also something that occurs more often with female patients. 
Jon Kabat-Zinn has stated, “Too often, the scientific and technological sophistication of the traditional medical approach to disease leads to an impersonal, sometimes even disembodied approach to the patient, as if medicine’s knowledge is so powerful that the patient’s understanding, cooperation, and collaboration in treatment are of minor value. When this attitude is displayed by a physician in his or her relationship to a patient, when the patient is made to feel, either through omission or commission, inadequate, ignorant, or in some way to blame, either for his condition or for his lack of response to the treatment, or when the person’s feelings are simply ignored, these are instances of grossly inadequate medical care”. He also stated, “The dignity of the patient needs to be honored and preserved throughout his or her entire sequence of medical encounters, whether they lead to a wholly successful outcome or not. It is not uncommon for doctors who become ill to discover for the first time in their lives the little and not-so-little insensitivities in the health care system that rob people of their dignity and sense of agency. At such times, as they make the transition from “doctor” to “patient,” they may be more likely to see that the latter role puts you at immediate risk for shame, loss of control, and reduced dignity, even though you are the same person you were before the role change.” Kabat-Zinn also writes that medical training with regard to the above is improving as physicians are increasingly being taught to attend to the whole person. 
In the book, “When Doctors Become Patients”, …says that in his interviews with 1—sick doctors he found a common theme that they had tended to believe they were impermeable to illness. They tended to have a very “us”and “them” view of doctors and patients. Many of them felt ashamed to be sick. It is disturbing to think how this view of illness as something to be ashamed of must have been felt by their patients. I think a better attitude would be one held amongst psychologists who use Acceptance and Commitment Therapy with their patients. This is the view that the doctor and the patient are both humans beings who are in the boat that is the human experience together. In a conversation I had with a seasoned psychiatrist colleague whom I greatly respect he stated that he sees himself as just one major life crisis away from being in his patient’s shoes. I was interested in his views on the subject because he always spoke about patients in meetings with a much greater degree of kindness and dignity than did some of his colleagues.  
How this affected me:
It is so strange to transition from the position of being the doctor (psychologist) in the room to being the patient in the room. As a successful professional, who has earned the name “doctor”, one becomes use to mostly being treated with respect. One’s opinions are sought and considered seriously. Prior to becoming a patient I viewed myself as being a strong woman. I had worked for years quite comfortably with the primarily male population of the VA system. Many were angry and hostile. Veterans can be challenging to deal with for sensitive, female therapists. Veterans come from the perspective of an often machismo military culture. Many have anger associated with both PTSD and also the way they have been treated by society. Despite being female, I worked well with them. I was comfortable around them. I led anger management groups which could be quite unruly at times. I have dealt calmly with suicidal and homicidal patients. I recall one day being approached by the VA chief of police and asked how I stay so calm. Another staff person called me “unflappable”. When I was wearing my “doctor” hat, I felt strong, self-assured, and had a sense of control. 
However, when thrust into the role of patient, particularly one with a mysterious chronic illness, all that is described above seemed to slip through my fingers. When I began interacting with the medical profession as a patient, I felt weak, out of control, and childlike. I certainly did not feel respected or as if anyone was interested in my thoughts or opinions. I was viewed not as a doctor, but as simply another patient. When trying to explain my strange symptoms, I sensed I had no control over how the doctor would view me. Such as, whether the doctor would dismissively lump me into the category of “hysterical female”. Actually, I learned from books I read on the topic and also from comments made directly to me by physicians, that my education and career led some to assume I was obsessive-compulsive or a Type A person who was likely causing or exaggerating my problems. I also read in some of my books on coping with chronic illness and also from personal experience, that if I acted like I particularly cared about my diagnosis and tried to get informed and ask questions, that it was more likely I would be viewed as anxious and hypochondriacal. All this made me feel of course frustrated, but also vulnerable, and vulnerability is not my comfort zone.
Prior to becoming a licensed psychologist, while going through training, my experience was that vulnerability is not rewarded. In training to become a psychologist, every year you must compete and interview for a slot for that year’s practical training. Within your coursework and your practical trainings you are being constantly evaluated and having to prove that you can hack it. You learn to behave like a professional and to not show weakness. In fact while being advised on how to interview, we were told when asked about weaknesses, to be very careful how we responded. We should answer with things that were actually a strength from an employer’s perspective. 
While I was training in neuropsychology in a university hospital setting, I spent 6-8 hours a day conducting psychological testing with one individual patient. My supervisor was closely guiding the process. She was also highly driven and focused. We worked right through lunch. I am not someone who can skip a meal. When I asked if we could take a break to get food, she seemed irritated. I later complained to the director of training about this and was given a lecture about how competitive this field is and that employers will be looking for any sign of weakness to rule you out. I was basically told to suck it up. This attitude was unfortunate in my opinion. It was a bit like what I have described about medical training. Thankfully, nothing this extreme occurred in the therapy training sites. However, I think there should be more emphasis placed on things such as self-care and comfort with vulnerability in psychology training in general. I think this would create better, well-rounded therapists.  
Overall, I excelled in graduate school. I received positive feedback from professors and supervisors. I became use to this and felt in control of how others viewed me, which was as a competent and capable woman.  So, graduate school taught me to be hide weakness and highlight strengths. I consistently proved myself as being up to the task at hand. Working as a professional emboldened me with more and more confidence as the years went on. Being treated with respect by others became my norm. 
Then WHAMO, I became a patient which means the opposite all those things. I learned that being a patient means in a major way, that you are now vulnerable and seeing a physician means owning up to your vulnerability through expressing basically, “I’m sick and I need help”. You must do this to get help. However, to do this you have to put yourself in a situation where you may end up feeling disrespected and infantilized. I tend to suddenly feel like a little girl when I enter an examining room. Then, if they cannot easily find a clear diagnosis, you may be blamed for causing your problem by your personality or lifestyle. When I got sick, I felt my sense of control fly out the window and was forced to embrace vulnerability as my new normal.
Jon Kabat-Zinn has stated, “When we become ill and seek medical care, and thereby inevitably take on the role of “patient,’ we are usually in a particularly vulnerable psychological state because we are naturally concerned about the larger implications of our illness. We are also, for the most part, in a position of substantial ignorance and little authority compared with our doctors, even though it is our body that is the subject of all the attention. In this situation, we may be unusually sensitive to the messages, both verbal and nonverbal, that we get from our doctors. These messages can either augment the healing process in us or subvert it altogether, if our doctor is insensitive to his or her own behaviors and the effects they can have on the person who is their patient.” 
Reminds me of how men tend feel when aging and facing issues like having their driver’s license taken away or spoken to like a child. Veteran returning from war after making life and death decisions, mastering ammunitions, then forced take entry level jobs. Makes me feel less alone. Know from experience no point in holding grudge.
Dr Swenson made feel brave and hopeful. 
Know not just me because heard over and over from patients with medical issues.   

Family and friends:
 tendency for others to be suspicious of the legitimacy of things they cannot see and to make hurtful comments as a result. The classic comment made by friends and family that shows up in almost every book on the topic is some variation of the statement “Well, you look fine”. 
 If family members cannot see the problem like a broken leg, and your doctor cannot quickly provide you with a diagnosis, family members too may jump to the conclusion that the problem is psychological. They may do this in part because it is too painful for them to accept that you will be chronically sick and a psychological diagnosis seems more hopeful and treatable.  
However, the effect this has on the sick person is that they feel the significance of what they are going through is being minimized. They feel both invalidated and blamed for somehow causing their own problem. “You look fine” feels invalidating because it conveys that the other person has no idea of the physical nightmare going on inside of you. When others say, “Your job is pretty stressful” or “Maybe if you exercise more or ate better” the sick person hears “It is your choice to be sick and it is in your control to fix it”. Of course they say these things with the best of intentions. However, the effect leads the person with chronic invisible illness to feel somehow ashamed and increasingly isolated. 
Another negative consequence of these comments is that the sick person, already dealing with baffling symptoms, may begin to doubt themselves and think, “Is this real?” or “Am I actually crazy?”
Luckily for me I had read about this phenomenon in books on the topic before many of the comments were flung my way. It was both hurtful and amusing to find that people in fact do say almost all of these things. I was surprised to find how predictable it was. As described in my Mayo Clinic visit encounter, I have witnessed a doctor jump to conclusions that my problem is psychological. I have also heard people say with quizzical looks on their faces, “Well, you look good”. Family members have made comments referencing my illness along the lines of “Well, your job is pretty stressful”, or more directly, “Maybe job stress made you sick”. One family member stated that I am a sensitive person and maybe could not handle my line of work (psychology). This is funny since this person hardly knows me, knows nothing of my professional abilities, and it seemed to me was projecting their own issues onto me. They are sensitive and have a low tolerance for dealing with others in distress. 
Of course the mind and the body are connected and so issues such as stress in your life are not to be dismissed. Stress can tax our bodies. However, this does not mean that stress caused the problem and entirely explains the problem. Stress tends to worsen symptoms of many conditions such as the autoimmune disorders. This does not mean the autoimmune disorder does not have a medical basis. Stress is also an inevitable part of life. Everyone experiences stress. So the message that seems to come along with “Maybe it is stress” is that you are just too weak to handle life. I my case, I had worked successfully under much more stressful conditions for many years prior to getting sick. For the several years leading up to when I became ill, my stress level was greatly minimized.  
One factor that helped me tremendously throughout these events was that my husband never made any of these types of comments. He knows me best and was the closest observer of all that occurred with my health. He always believed what I was telling him I was experiencing and constantly encouraged me. He would also tease me at times by pretending the opposite such as when I stated that I felt tired, he would state “Well, you must be depressed and better get out of the house” or “Well, you better just buck up and push through it.” We would then laugh and this helped me hold lightly the views of others. 
After taking the downturn in my health that led me to apply for FMLA, I decided to take up my PCP’s suggestion and visit a psychologist who specialized in working with those with chronic illness. I knew my PCP did not make this referral because she though my illness was psychological, but because she wanted me to have adequate support. I felt so beaten down that I agreed I needed to increase my support. The psychologist was wonderful. She gave me the opportunity to describe all that had happened with kind patience and also a sense of curiosity. She created a safe atmosphere where I learned that my experiences would be validated and not dismissed. As I relayed my tale she empathized about how frightening it must have been and interjected with her own strong feelings of anger about how some of the physicians had handled themselves. She stated that most of her patients had horrifying stories about physician insensitivity. It wasn’t just me. I started to express my own feelings of anger. This helped to replace my feelings of victimization with a sense of empowerment. Also, after gathering a thorough history, listening to all that had happened and how I was handling it, and seeing me over a period of several months, she told me she did not think there was any psychological basis to explain my symptoms and that she did not think I met criteria for any psychiatric diagnosis. She stated that I was coping very well with what had happened and was doing all the right things with little prompting from her. 
This was good to hear and carried more weight for me than the comment from the physician about somatization disorder.  This is because the psychologist has actual psychological training and did a lengthy psychological evaluation. The physician who made the somatization disorder comment did not do any type of psychological assessment with me. 
Research on somatization disorder……
Toni Bernhard’s list of things not to say to the chronically ill.

Thus, for anyone reading this book who has a chronic illness, I encourage you to find yourself a good therapist. It helps to discuss what is happening with someone who listens well and responds appropriately. Since you may not get this in other relationships, it can be vital. However, I would also say to do your research. Ask around to get a good recommendation. Your physician may know someone. Also, many therapists have online profiles that describe their style of therapy and their experience. Any good therapist will be able to help; however finding one who has experience with the chronically ill is likely best. If you meet a therapist and get a bad feeling about it, look for another one. All therapists are not equal and not all of them will be a good fit for you. The main thing I needed from my therapist was someone to listen and be supportive. This is because I was getting specific tips for coping with my situation from the books I was reading. However, if you are not getting what you need from self-hyelp books and dealing with specific issues such as managing chronic pain, anxiety, or depression, it is good to know that supportive listening is often not enough from a therapist. Some therapists provide little more than support. However, others who are trained in evidence-based treatments such as cognitive-behavioral therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy will offer more. They will help teach specific skills, exercises, and provide more active guidance. These forms of therapy are the ones that have strong research support backing them. Don’t hesitate to ask your therapist in the first meeting what their therapeutic orientation is. If they have trouble answering this, this is cause for concern. If they say they are client-centered then this means they will primarily offer you support, but not teach you skills. If they say they use CBT or ACT as mentioned above, the therapist will likely be more active and interested in using evidence-based approaches.   

I am so used to interacting with other therapists that I have become somewhat spoiled when it comes to expecting that others will listen actively when I am discussing something important to me. I think this is partly why I was so horrified at some of the comments made by phsysicians. I take for granted that active listening is a given as it becomes second nature for therapists. However, they are not trained to do this.
Validate, validate, validate – the chronically ill need validation. They need to feel seen and heard. They need to feel that others believe them when they say they don’t feel well. Validation of what another is saying is a communication skill that is helpful in general. However, a striking example of its usefulness is in the treatment of Borderline Personality Disorder. This is a condition that is extremely difficult to treat. Therapists had little success with the condition until Marsha Linehan came along and developed Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Those with this condition are thought to be born with a tendency to feel emotions more intensely than others. However, because those around them, typically parents, do not know how to respond to what appears to be an over-reaction to situations, the child’s pain is invalidated. The child’s emotional displays are met with comments that minimize what they are experiencing such as “Its not that bad” or comments that encourage suppression of emotion such as “Don’t cry”. This is confusing for the child and so they cry or scream louder and louder in an attempt to get the message across. As children and adults they are sometimes viewed with suspicion as exaggerating for the purpose of attention. However, these individuals are not exaggerating. Their pain is very real. Also, in addition to having their suffering invalidated these individuals are not taught how to cope with their strong emotions. 
The genius of Marsha Linehan’s work relates to the word dialectical. Two seemingly opposing forces must be simultaneously held together. What seems to be opposites are both true. Therapists working with these patients must learn to both validate the intensity of the pain AND also challenge the patient to cope. If a therapist does one without the other, then progress is not made. If the patient does not feel heard (validated) then they will not be receptive to being challenged. If they are only validated then they will never learn to cope.  Since anger becomes a predominate feature of this condition in part due to years of experiencing invalidation, the therapist may find themselves becoming the object of the patient’s rage. The therapist will need to make statements such as “You’re so pissed!” and “Now what skill can you use right now to cope with it”. 
Referring back to the realm of the chronically ill, if a physician were to take the time to make a statement such as “Wow, you’ve been feeling like hell” or “That sounds rough!” it would go a long way. As I have stated my PCP has exceptional bedside manner. She understands the value of validation. During one of the most difficult and humbling moments of my life, when I had to tell her I no longer thought I could work and to ask her to complete disability paperwork for me, she jumped into reading it over. Then she stopped, sat back in her chair and looked at me. She said, “I’m just stuck by how hard this must be for you” and “I know what it took to get to this point in your life (a licensed psychologist) and what this must mean for you”. Wow. I felt oodles of tension melt away as I realized she got it and she cared.  
I was used to being on the other side of the table. I worked for three years doing disability evaluations for Veterans. I would say that the majority of those I saw felt humiliated to be asking for help and expected to have to go into battle to defend themselfes. 
Research the change in medical training regarding beside manner.
Thomas empathy dizziness, , pity party hat

Emmy – having psychologists as friends. Never invalidate or minimize. Any good therapist knows this. It is foundational. But family ane friends without this training do not and they say hurtful things. Books on chroni illness helped prepare me. People did exactoy what was warned such as say when there is horrify8ng turbulence inside and you are struggling to sit there and talk to them, and they say “Well, you like good”. This ismeant as a compliment I believe. They are trying to find one good thing th3y can focus on to be encouraging. However, for people who have a condition that others can’t see, this is invalidating. Therapists know the important of validation and would never make such a sttment. 
Others who are healthy struggle to know what to saqy to you. They cannot relat. This is why group therapy can be wo powerful. I have seen how it can be like water for the thirsty to join a group of people ith similar issues and finally feel they are not alone. I’ve have seen this happen for combat Veterans who have gone many years thinking they are the only one experiencing strange and confusing symptoms. When they go to group they finally realie, “I’m not crazy. 
Chronic pain group membes are particularly skilled at supporting each oth3r. I was involved with a pain group during myinternship training and it was remarkable to see how sensitive the group members were to each oth3r pain. They were so kind. My supervisor ho led th4 group explained thqt people who are hurting develop compssio nd empathy for others who are in pain. This is one of the gifts of suffering. It is difficult for those who have not suffered or struggled to have the patience and awareness to listen well to thoe who are sffering. 
The disability process – vet’s angry about having to prove self and needing validation sometimes more than $. Dr. Swenson paused while reading over disability paperwork requirements “this must be so difficult for you, I am so sorry this is happening to you’. Tears. Hug. Put a blanket on me.
ACT – therapist and patient in the boat together. Dr. Schenkl – self disclosure, anger. Screen your therapist. Supportive vs evidence-based treatment. What I needed from a therapist was the opportunity to tell my story in a safe and validating environment. Coping skills from books. Active listing is a foundational therapeutic skill and extremely powerful. Most of us rarely have the experience of feeling truly heard by another person. However, some therapists stop here. They offer support and nothing more. This is often not enough. Often we need to learn new skills in order to move forward and improve. 
Rumination and anger
Veteran accused of molestation – whole communit against him – needed validation from me that he not bad person. Listen his side of story. 
It is good and important to find trusted souls who provide with the nurturing milk of validation. However, you still have to interact with individuals who do not provide it. This is where I found it again useful to let go of control. My need to be validated by and respected by everyone. Through practicing acceptance of things I could not control, I came to realize that other people’s attitudes towards me fall into that category. So, I began to put up some emotional boundaries. I decided to let go of concern over other’s opinions and judgments of me. I decided with my husband, my therapist, certain key friends, and most importantly, my own validation and respect, I could let go of what other’s think. 
I also came to consider that I could adopt a don’t know mind as to whether there is a psychological component to my problem. IN particularly, that stress and my own sensitivity to stress had contributed. Within my disgust over doctors being too quick to dismiss medical issues as psychological ones (which is a big problem), I also began to act as if have a psychological problem was something to be ashamed of. I don’t truly believe this; however in the midst of it all, I somehow got caught up in society’s stigma towards mental illness and became overly defensive. 
Use example of fibromyalgia – thought made up or psychologically based – new research say otherwise.   
Got leter from opthalmaolgist I needed a yearly check up of a spot they found in corner of my eye make sure not growing. Last thing I wanted was to drag myself into a doctor’s appointment,  Feeling crappy and in bed mostly at that time. Went in feeling a little like tearing up because I felt too sick to be there. Nurse had no idea why I was there, obviously had not looked at my records and said “So, why are you taking each of your medications?” I did not have the mental energy to think about how to answer that question. I looked at her blankly. She said, “I mean, can you give me your medical history. I go to a medical facility that uses electronic records. All my notes from my primary doctor and specialists are there in the system. So I said, “All my records are there in the computer system including my diagnoses, I have a lot of them, can’t you just look at it?” She opened a paper file and looked at some notes joted down a year ago by the eye doctor. She started asking me about small surgeries I had had many years ago. Because she had not read anything about me, she was really wasting my time and energy. Then of course, I had to repeat it all when the doctor came in. I don’t really understand this process. This reminded me of all the Veterans I have heard complain about having to retell their story, from the beginning, over and over to new medical staff, because no one reads their records first. 
Dr. Oniel – Mysterious symptoms + history of anxiety = somatization disorder.
Example substance abuse group internship – stress. Nothing else scary on that scale. First time I encountered a DID patient switch identies andgenders. 
I have observed through this experience of getting sick that people in my life want clear answers about what is wrong and why it happened. If they are not given those, then they make their own assumptions. This seems to especially happen when you don’t get better as people have difficulty accepting that sometimes things can’t be fixed. I have gotten the impression that people make assumptions without the humility of recognizing these are assumptions and instead embrace false certainty with gusto. Especially if there is not a simple medical explanation and when you don’t get better. We all have a need to find meaningful explanations for things, explanations that make sense of our world. To do this we often jump to conclusions. A fancy way of saying this is we use heuristics. We look at things through our own lens of bias and draw conclusions with shocking confidence. This is necessary for us to function in the world up to a point. However, it can be a problem when we do not keep an open mind that there may be alternate explanations. One way I have observed this since getting sick is people’s tendency to keep asking “have you got a clear diagnosis yet?” or “have the doctor’s figured it out yet?”. These questions keep coming even after a lengthy process of medical testing and being given my diagnosis by the Mayo Clinic. People in my life don’t seem to be satisfied with an explanation that is unusual, that is that I got sick with a viral infection and never got better. Despite having this explained, they keep asking as if there is no diagnosis. I don’t know if this is because they don’t believe it or cannot recall I have already explained it to them. They also keep expecting that I will get better and seem mystified when myself or my husband has to tell them, “Yes, Lisa is still sick”. 
In terms of explanations, just like doctors tend to assume psychological explanations when they cannot find a clear medical explanation, I have noticed a tendency for others in my life to do the same. Some assume that stress from my work must have caused my sickness. I have heard comments like, “She is too sensitive for that kind of work” and “It makes sense that you were vicariously traumatized by all the war stories you heard” and “I wonder how all the years of stress on the job contributed?” Some of these people hardly know me. Some think they know me better than they do. They know me personally; however no nothing of my professional self. 
By contrast, those that knew me in my professional role seemed to see me very differently. I have repeatedly heard comments from various colleagues that relate to how calm I remain during difficult situations or in dealing with difficult patients. When overhearing me dealing with an angry, demanding individual they later commented “You are unflappable”. A former VA chief of police who was often called to handle crises in the mental health department relating to an angry Veteran knew I ran anger management groups and often saw me interacting with the Veterans before and after the groups. He once said, “What is your secret for staying so calm?” I have worked on in-patients units with suicidal and homicidal individuals, I have worked individually and in group therapy with many rough individuals. I have also heard numerous tales that could break your heart. However this did not make me anxious. I get anxious over silly things, usually related to money or to my tendency towards perfectionism. The most stressful aspect of working at the VA for me was when we had not yet figured out how to proprelly manage the sudden influx of patients that came in to mental health following the recent Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Because of the size of our patient loads, we could only see people for individual treatment on a monthly basis. This is not a basis for effective therapy. The fact that I was being forced to do sub-optimal treatment infuriated me. Eventually a powerful group within the VA forced a movement towards the use of Evidence-Based Practices within psychotherapy. This meant using the best treatments that were strongly supported by research. To do this, we had to be permitted to see peole on a weekly basis if we thought they could benefit from this type of therapy. The VA also began utilizing more group therapy formats so that more individuals could be helped. This improved things; however we still had to see many individuals on a monthly basis and found this untenable. This is one of the reasons I switched to a different, more assessment focused role in the VA. When I did this, my major workplace stress eased. 
My self-image within the workplace given the feedback I received form colleagues and my own perception of how I handled things was that of a strong person who was experienced and comfortable working in mental health. My job was stressful at times; however hearing painful stories is not what I found stressful. I have always felt at ease being with people who are in distress and listening to what is on their minds without retreating. This is partly what drew me to becoming a mental health professional in the first place. I realized hearing about sad things and not getting overwhelmed or lost in it was a skill that came naturally to me. Whereas, I observed that not everyone can do this. Also, mental health professionals learn how to do this as they gain experience. I preferred to get into the thick of things with patients and discuss the meat of what brought them in. Patients who talk about surface topics due to avoidance or because they are not capable of going very deep can be boring for therapists. I became desensitized to the gore of war stories over time. I tended to enjoy that every day I was going to hear something new and interesting. This was stimulating not particularly stressful. I know not everyone is wired this way and that is why it takes a particular personality to become a therapist, particularly one who works with trauma. My ability to sit in the presence of suffering with another person without turning away is one of my strengths and something that gave me a sense of purpose. So, it has been frustrating when people who know nothing of what I am like in the workplace or my capacity to do my job have concluded that it is my job that made me sick because I could not handle it. It is difficult to have something about you that gives you a sense of pride and accomplishment, that is my ability to skillfully handle my work and have that somehow dismissed.  It is also difficult to realize you have no control over this. You cannot really defend yourself without sounding defensive. Also, people are going to think what they are going to think and you must accept this.
There are theories used to justify drawing the simple conclusion. Ockham’s Razor. Don’t look for zebras. However, in my experience life more typically fits what I observe in crime dramas. There is usually one good detective who recognizes that things are often not what they seem. This detective will dig a little deeper and find there is more to the story. This is similar to the scientist who recognizes that correlation is not causation. However, we all tend to assume if something seems related on the surface, then it must be. 
I must admit that I am human just like everyone else who makes assumptions about me. I have made assumptions about others with unfair confidence. I think we could all benefit from developing some humility in their area and letting go of our arrogance. Consider your own life and the people in it. How often to you draw judgmental conclusions about others without having all the facts?      
I have always cared about how others viewed me. I have wanted to be liked, viewed as kind and cooperative, and independent. I have not wanted to be viewed as needy or weak.  However, when I got sick I no longer had the strength or energy to portray the image that I wished. I could no longer please everyone or fully provide for myself. For example, I care about how my in-laws see me. I would like them to believe there son made a good choice in marrying me. However, now that I am sick I can no longer potray the image or the perfect daughter-in-law. My husband has to do more for me than he used to and my sickness has inevitably caused him stress. I cannot attend all the family gatherings I once did which often means he does not attend either. Thus, I can no longer control how my in-laws view me and whether they think my husband could have done better. I have learned a couple things about how to cope with this. I have to practice letting go of needing people to view me a certain way. I have to practice letting go of control of what others think. I use the word practice because it is not a one time thing. It takes continual work. But I find the more I practice the easier it get.  And this is not a bad thing. It has forced me to come to a more balanced place regarding my need to please. Others may have an easier time with this. 
A psychologist friend of mine once commented about a therapy group she ran, “There seems to be givers and takers”. Some people’s problem is that they give too much and others in the group have the opposite problem. They take too much. You can see it in the problems that arise in their personal lives that they share in group and also in how they interact with each other within the group. Going to either extreme can be a problem and striving for a balanced middle ground is a healthier way to go. In DBT, boundaries…… I have observed from clinical experience that individuals who are “takers” or more entitled are more comfortable with the sick role. They like being dependent and don’t feel a bit guilty. However, others who are more like me and strive for independence and personal responsibility have a very difficult time making the adjustment to being sick. 
I have noticed some people in my life have a need to come up with psychological explanations for why I am chronically sick that utterly disregards what my doctors have said and what I myself have said to explain my illness.  It got back to me that one person said that I am just too sensitive for the kind of work that I did as a psychologist and since I could not handle it, I got sick. Excuse me? Considering that this person does not know me well at all and knows nothing of who I was in my professional capacity, this is baffling. How is it that this person sees me in this light when none of many psychology supervisors and teachers over the years did not? A highly skilled psychologist once told me that when people say hurtful things towards you, instead of simply personalizing it, it is important to consider things such as their agenda and/or their biases. They are looking at a situation through the lens of their own biases and what they are saying may say more about them than about you. For example, in other contexts this particular individual has made comments along the lines of that they view people who go into helping professions as being crazy. For example, they frequently make derogatory comments about nurses along the lines of that anyone who would want to care give must be nuts. They seem to view people in helping professions as martyr types. This person is a hard-driven business type. I have observed that this individual becomes overwhelmed when dealing with others who are in emotional crisis. So, given their own limitations, they cannot fathom being able to work as a professional therapist. Thus, when I got sick with an invisible chronic illness, they assumed it was because of my job. 
Another individual in my life who is much closer to me floored me when they shared their view on my illness. I had tried to keep this person well informed about health problems. For example, I had told them all about the diagnoses of B12 deficiency, central and peripheral nervous system disorder, oscillopsia, and a likely underlying autoimmune condition. I had described the debilitating fatigue, extreme sensitivity to heat, migraines, and visual disturbances. I had told them that a psychologist who specializes in working with clients with chronic illness had assessed me and worked with me over months concluding I have no diagnosable psychological condition and that I cope excellently. I had described how well I think I cope overall considering through the use of mindfulness and acceptance. And yet on one occasion, after I shared my frustration with some of the ignorant comments people make, this person said “I have wondered if the problem was psychological and related to your inability to have a baby.” Huh? I felt gutted. I had spilled my guts to this person throughout the course of my illness and they were clearly not seeing or hearing me at all. When I asked where in the world they got this idea from, they paused and said that they didn’t really know. I said, “I have told you I don’t want children”. I said, “I could see if I was moping around, depressed, and complaining about not having children”. They said, “I know, I guess maybe I’m projecting my own desire for you to have a baby”. Now we were getting somewhere.  This says a lot about societies discomfort with the childfree; however that is a subject for another book. 
I reminded them of all that I had reported about what my doctors had said and this individual behavred as if they were hearing it for the first time, as if they had simply tuned it all out when I had mentioned it before. I said “why would you conclude all these physical symptoms are psychological? Why would you jump to that?” I said “I am a psychologist, I have a Ph.D., why can you not trust that I know myself enough to know that is not the issue”.  They replied, “I have read a lot about the mind/body connection” and “you don’t have to have a Ph.D to know something about psychology”. Ugh. This person is not trained in psychiatric diagnoses. I am certain they could not tell you the criteria for diagnosing depression or psychosomatic illness. I will explore this issue more below; however, I also said to them “I think the meaning of research into the mind/body connection has been greatly exaggerated in the popular press”. 
This same individual has recommended mind/body books to me that make, in my opinion, exaggerated statements along the lines of “You can heal yourself!” (of basically anything) particularly utilizing the power of the placebo effect. I explained to them that I think they are more optimistic than I am about the extent to which my healing is under my control and that I find an acceptance based approach (I might get better, I might not and it is all okay) more helpful. I explained how being sick can teach you the limits of your control and the reality of your fragility as a mortal human being. I thought we made some headway towards understanding one another and then the next day this person said out of the blue, “You must have been confronted with a lot of sad situations in your work at the VA and had to work really hard to find a way to cope”. Eh? This person was assuming my coping style was pessimistic (versus realistic as I see it) and that this was caused by the effects of my job. There is was, my job was the cause again. Instead that as a chronically ill person I had gained some helpful insight about life. The underlying message was that I had caused my illness through psychological means.    
I did find therapy once per mo with people stressful, because I had a conscioene andit was wrong. I switched to a role low stress. Felt comfortable hearing stories of trauma – honor. Gave me sense of purpose to know I could sit calmly and nonjudgmentally and hear these stories and hold them. Then introduce to therapy. Hurt have people say I am sick because I could not handle this.
How Tara Brach and radical acceptance helped me cope with mom’s comments (there is nothing wrong with me). Something else that helped my anger ease was the recognition that I have been guilty of the same judgments in the past. Being in the role of psychologist, I have at times been guilt of drawing naïve assumptions about patients complaining of vague medical symptoms or of nonspecific chronic pain. When they seem consumed by their pain and want to speak of nothing else, I have somewhat unconsciously, put distance between myself and them by assuming their complaints are more related to their personality than to actual pain. Thus, I then assume because I do not have their personality, I would never be in their shoes. Again, I must say that this happens beneath my conscious awareness. However, now that I am in their shoes, I am painfully humbled. I understand the feeling that you want to perpetually complain to others about your circumstances in order to have your experience validated. I understand how frustrating it is to have symptoms that no one else can see. I understand how real they can be and how they can cloud out everything else. I am no different from my former patients. We are all human beings for whom health and life are fragile and easily taken for granted by the healthy. In my professional role I have encountered others, a couple of psychiatrists in particular, who clearly see themselves as above their patients. Who speak of their difficult patients with disdain. I once was challenged by an intern I was supervising to address this. AS she had witnessed the same behavior by these particular psychiatrists. This intern had a family member with a mental illness and understandably found the comments of these psychiatrists personally offensive. As I reflected on her concern I decided to consult another psychiatrist for whom I had great respect about how to handle the situation. I told him that I have never observed speaking about even the most difficult of patients with anything but kindness and patience. His response stuck with me. He said “The way I think about it is that I am only one tragic life event away from being in their shoes”. In other words, he was saying that he is not different from his patients, just luckier. What humility and wisdom.     
People say stupid stuff at times mostly because they don’t know any better. They do it to those who are grieving, “They’re in heaven now” or ‘You just need to move on” or “I know how you feel”. They say it to combat Veterans recently returned from the combat zone, belief systems turned upside down, “Did you kill anyone”, “What’s it like over there?”, “Get over it”. Even “Thank you for your service” has a different dark meaning to many Veterans than it does to the ignorant one who is saying it. So to people say stupid things to the sick. When I have been tempted to ruminate on these scenarios and how annoyed I am, I remember how I helped Veterans learn to accept that most people are speaking out of ignorance and not maliciousness. If you take offense and hold on to it every time someone steps on your toes then you will be very unhappy. Thanks again to my former patients for blazing a trail for me.  
Parent comments last visit – mom said lucky have tom, other men wouldn’t put up with. Dad said he has wondered if it is psychological because I can’t have a ababy. Re: my acceptance based attitude he sees as giving up/pessimism, he commebted, “you must have heard a lot of sad stories at the VA”. 
Kunning duger? People who know a little from popular psych books think they are doctors.
Some people say stupid stuff: To the grieving they say, “I understand how you feel” or “You need to move on”. To homosexuals they say “I love the sinner but not the sin”. To minorities they say, “Racism no longer exists” and “Get over it”. To the chronically ill they say, “But you look fine” and “My friend got better with ……..” and I could go on and on.  
The therapist I have worked with to help me cope with my illness specializes in working with those with chronic illnesses. She once stated that in her experience, her patients pursue therapy not so much to help them cope with the illness itself, but to help them cope with the reactions of the other people in their lives to their illness and reduced functioning. She stated this typically falls along the lines of a spouse or parent not understanding the sick person’s limitations. Based on this comment and also my own experience with being disappointed and offended by the comments of others about my predicament, I began to wonder, why do others respond so negatively to the sick? Why do they make hurtful comments? Why is it so hard for them to understand? 
I found myself drawing on my psychology training and what this suggests about what may be driving the hurtful behavior of others. The psychodynamic theory of defense mechanisms such as denial and projection came to mind. Also, I began thinking about common errors in human judgment that have been revealed by the field of cognitive and social psychology. I decided to review these concepts here in order to possibly illuminate for those struggling with feeling judged by others, what may be going on. I think this can be helpful as it may help empower those with illness by learning to not personalize what others say. My aim is to help create an emotional buffer for the ill to help protect them against offensive comments and behavior. 
Let’s start by exploring some of the findings of cognitive psychology. One sub-area within this field looks specifically the tendency of humans to make systematic errors in judgment and decision making due to cognitive biases. The father of this area is nobel prize winning psychologist, Daniel Kahneman.  Kahneman states, “You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way.” Kahneman’s books “Thinking fast and slow” illustrates that there are two systems of thought operating in our minds, the conscious, deliberate one and the unconscious, intuitive one. The intuitive one, that involves the thoughts that first and most easily come to mind, though helpful in many ways, is also highly vulnerable to error. 
He and his colleague, Amos Tversky, started their groundbreaking research with the question, “Are people good intuitive statisticians?” Their research revealed that in fact, they are not. They began looking at their own research process with a microscope and found that their own subjective judgments were often faulty. For example, they found they were “far too willing to believe research findings based on inadequate evidence and prone to collect too few observations in our own research”. They found that their expert colleagues were too optimistic about whether results of an experiment would be replicable. 
They went on to develop the field of heuristics, which are the short-hand ways out mind’s make sense of the world. These heuristics are prone to error. One commonly used heuristic they discovered is the availability heuristic. This involves the “reliance on the ease of memory” to determine such things as the importance of an issue. This is then shaped by the media. People are interested in dramatic events, thus that is what the media exposes them too. This then influences the public’s view of the frequency and significance of dramatic events. 
Another is the resemblance heuristic. This involves the tendency to assume that if someone resembles a stereotypical category, we wrongly predict they will go on to become a part of that category while ignoring other more informative data.
Another is the substitution heuristic. When faced with a difficult questions, humans often substitute an easier one and answer it without being aware they have done this. For example, when asked to consider who would make the best president during a campaign, instead of doing the deliberate work of trying to answer such a question, they instead might answer as if the question was, “who do you like the most?” They substitute an easy question for a harder one. Kahneman give the example of an executive who invested a large sum of money in Fort Motors. When Kahneman asked him how he reached the decision to do so, the executive stated he basically went with his gut reaction, based on viewing Ford vehicles at an automobile show. Kahneman points out this has little to do with the important questions an economist would consider.  
Kahneman also writes about our tendency to fall for cognitive illusions. If we are told something that is easily processed and familiar to us we tend to believe it is true. This can be influenced by the use of repetition. When we are presented with something repeatedly, it becomes more familiar and we feel a sense of cognitive ease when we encounter it. As Kahneman points out, this is known and utilized by marketers and authoritarian institutions to persuade people to believe their messages. They know to keep the message simple and memorable. For example, people tend to buy stocks that have easily pronounceable names over those that are tongue-twisters.   
Another factor which influences human thought on an unconscious level is what psychologists called priming. Ideas are connected in a massive network within our minds, called associative memory. Most of the activity of this network go on outside of our awareness. When we are exposed to a particular word  or idea, then other related words and ideas become more readily available to our conscious minds. This is called the priming effect. When we are primed with something, related ideas come more easily to mind. And we do not know this is happening. The impact of priming on our day to day lives is considerable. For example, we may think that our voting decisions are the result of careful analysis; however studies have shown that they can be influenced by things as trivial as where our polling station is located. Specifically, voters were shown to vote more often to increase funding for schools when their polling location was at a school.    
We should all be a little more humble regarding judging each other. Don’t be too quick to think you know what another person’s experience is. Don’t oversimplify another’s situation or think you understand the problem better than they do. Psychologists are trained to consider how their own bias clouds how they see a patient. They are also trained to think about how their words will be heard and to put themselves in the shoes of the other and try to see things through their eyes before clumsily blurting things out. I forget that others do not have this training.  Book in Real Simple – by woman with disabled son. 



 Chapter Four
Sorting Through Advice – cognitive psychology – control vs acceptance
Warning: This chapter involves a critique of some of the alternative treatments that have been suggested to me. It is written from the perspective of a skeptic. If you are someone who treasures alternative medicine and are not interested in having that challenged, you may want to skip this chapter. 
After learning and sharing with family, friends, and coworkers that conventional medicine, including the Mayo Clinic, had nothing to offer me, I began to receive well-intentioned advice about alternative things I could be doing to get well. It has been suggested that I try various supplements, acupuncture, Ayurvedic medicine, and something called energy work. I have been encouraged to see what is called a functional medicine doctor. I have had people tell me all about the extreme diet they believe in that has made them feel better or helped them overcome some ailment. I have been told that my problem might relate to the build-up of toxins in my system. I have also been recommended various books on self-healing and mind-body medicine. 
As time has passed others in my life continue to ask if I’m still sick. They then seemed baffled when my husband or I respond, “Yes, she’s still sick”. It is as if many healthy people have a difficult time believing that there is such a thing as “chronic” illness. They continue to offer suggestions about additional things I should be trying to get well. They seem to think that, if I could just find the right formula, whether it be through Western or alternative medicine, I would get well. I understand that all this comes out of concern for me; however it tends to make me feel a sense of being judged for somehow not more proactively getting myself fixed. At some point I began to wonder should I try these treatments?
I’ve heard various arguments for these alternative methods of healing. One argument is that although there is no real science supporting things such as acupuncture and Ayurvedic medicine, they must be useful since they have been done by large segments of the world for centuries. The logic offered to support various dietary changes has been “I’ve been feeling better since I started eating this way”. Or, “It works for me”. 
Before I say more about each of these suggestions, let me say something about the factors that affect how I hear them. I hear them through the lens of being a natural skeptic, having a research background, and also as a sick person. 
The skeptic me versus the sick me:  
In general, I am a skeptic. I question things. I can remember doing so since childhood. This has not always been appreciated by other. I recall at age 13 or 14 questioning my Bible teacher by saying things like, “But how do you know that”? This did not go over well. I was actually taken aside and reprimanded for possibly interfering with the spiritual growth of the other students. As is typical for adolescents I went on to have a conversion experience and was on fire for my faith for awhile. As is also typical, this faded with time and for me became ripe with doubts. There are questions that society subtly and not so subtly conveys should not be asked. But I tend to ask them. Some of the big ones for me have been, “Is there a God?” and “Should I have children?” Instead of leaping into the pool of parenthood, I have spent much time questioning whether it is the right thing for me.  When I developed religious doubts, I left my job, attended Seminary, and completed a Master’s Degree in Theology to explore my concerns. I think Buddhism has becoming appealing to me later in life because of my skeptical nature. The Buddha encouraged us to test everything for yourself and not to simply adopt what others say as truth. 
I’ve learned from experience that most people do not question things as I do. A good example would be a memory I have of sitting in a café with a good friend while I was going through a period of religious doubt. I was trying to discuss my doubts about the existence of God with her and she stated somewhat blankly, “Why do you ask questions like that? You just believe”. Well, this just didn’t work for me. Regarding the decision to have children, numerous books have recently been published about how unreflective most people are when it comes to this decision. Most people think, “Of course I will have children. That is just what you do”.
So, you would think that I would apply this same skepticism to suggestions about alternate forms of healing. But when I got sick, I found that my skeptical nature seemed to go underground. I was so fearful about what was happening to me and so desperate to be well, that I tended to listen to and try out some of the advice I was given without applying critical thought or conducting any research. I tended to fall prey to thinking that since modern, Western medicine couldn’t fix me, I would look elsewhere. And since fear and longing to be well made me vulnerable, I was open to pretty much anything. Fear has a powerful way of shutting down rationale decision making.  
My husband is even more of a skeptic than me and unlike me he feels compelled to directly challenge anyone who recommends healing based on pseudo-science. He gets quite worked up over it. He would get frustrated when I would want to try some of the advice I had been given. I would say something along the lines of that there are things out there science does not yet understand, so maybe I should give it a whirl just in case it works. This really got him going. He would respond by describing not only the financial consequences of trying things willy nilly, but also the potential health risks. I would say, “whatever”. 
Then one day someone recommended a treatment to me called Tapping. They said that this had something to do with energy imbalances in the body being corrected and that it helps with both medical and psychological problems. They stated they know a woman who cured herself of multiple sclerosis using energy work. They also said they know a nurse who has become certified in Tapping and is successfully treating phobias. This got my attention. Someone without proper mental health training or licensure is treating people with phobias with something called Tapping? This was now stepping into my domain as a licensed mental health professional. Instead of rushing to judgment I decided to read up on Tapping. 
The founder of tapping is Roger Callahan. He calls it Thought Field Therapy. I went to his website and learned that he categorizes it as a “Meridian Energy Psychology Therapy”.  The website includes claims such as that thought field therapy can be used to “instantly conquer your fears, anxieties, and emotional distress”. Also it claims to treat conditions such as trauma and obesity. As a licensed clinical psychologist, when I read statements such as that there is a way to “instantly conquer” conditions such as anxiety, I became extremely skeptical. No, let me be honest. I immediately knew that claim is bullshit. There are no instant cures for conditions such as anxiety. Renowned psychologist, academic, and contributor to the development of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Kelly Wilson, Ph.D. says in his book on anxiety entitled, “Things might go terribly, horribly wrong”, that anxiety cannot be cured and is simply part of being alive. So, being hit with language like “instantly conquer” on the founder of tapping’s website made me question the validity of the treatment before I knew anything more.   
In “Can We Really Tap Our Problems Away: A Critical Analysis of Thought Field Therapy”, Gaudiano and Herbert point to Callahan’s writings which claim there are such things as invisible energy fields within our bodies and that they can get blocked leading to psychological disorders these blockages are treated by clients being instructed to tap on various energy meridians on their body while simultaneously humming or counting. If a person does this while thinking about an event that distressed them, their blockages will be corrected. The tapping supposedly adds energy to the system which then balances the body’s energy (Callahan & Callahan 1997). 
Huh? At this point I was humbled to think that I was considering acupuncture for myself to address my fatigue knowing that the treatment had something to do with “meridians”. Yet in the context of the medical realm where I felt ignorant I felt open to something mystical sounding. However, now that I was reading about such concepts being proposed to treat conditions within the realm of my expertise, I suddenly found it absurd. I find this inconsistency in my thinking to be nteresting.
Gaudiano and Herbert state that there is no empirical evidence that invisible energy fields exist and that TFT even draws from scientifically discredited practices such as Applied Kinesiology. Gaudiano and Herbert also point out that TFT is marketed primarily via the internet by making extraordinary claims of success. The treatment is marketed to clinicians with claims of 97% effectiveness for something called Voice Technology (Callahan 1998). This involves healing clients over the phone somehow. Practitioners are charge3d $100,000 to learn the treatment and must sign non-disclosure agreements regarding reveal how it works. Fishy! Various TFT websites make claims of offering cures for a wide range of psychological disorders. With such extravagant claims would you not expect there to be some scientific validation for TFT? Well, there is not. “No controlled studies have been published in peer reviewed scientific journals”. 
Callahan justifies this by pointing to dramatic scenes of him “successfully” conducting TFT with people on television programs such as Leeza Gibbons and Oprah. This is not the same thing as scientific evidence. As Gaudiano and Herbert point out the presence of demand characteristics, which is pressure to conform to what is expected in such a situation. No standardized measures of symptom change are used either. The authors highlight a glaring issue. Callahan has supposedly been successfully using these treatments for over 20 years, so he has certainly had time to conduct respectable clinical trials and have them published. 
A 1999 study of TFT used for trauma by Carbonell and Figley was not published in a peer reviewed journal. It was too methodologically flawed to be interpreted meaningfully. It included no control group. The subjects were measured pre-treatment and six months post-treatment. Thus confounding factors such as natural improvement over time, regression towards the mean, or placebo effects could explain the modest improvements noted. Why weren’t subjects measured immediately post-treatment? Suspicious. Also, subjects were not properly diagnosed with Post-traumatic Stress Disorder thus it was not clear to what degree they were actually distressed by their trauma. The researchers did not use statistical methods for analysis of their data and instead based their conclusions on eyeballing it. Even then, the supposed improvement in symptoms were small and not consistent with the claims made by Callahan. 
Gaudiano and Herbert point out that although proponents of TFT assert that the tapping sequences are the mechanisms of action in their treatment, in fact it may be other aspects of what is being done that explains any observed improvements. These could include things common across all psychotherapies such as the support offered by the therapist, demand characteristics, expectations of improvement, and effort justification. Additionally, TFT practitioners have clients call to mind distressing memories and also to make coping statements such as “I accept and forgive them for what they did”. To some extent this is drawing from respectable psychotherapies such as exposure treatment and cognitive therapy. 
(Add some reference here such as HEAT and specifics about what can go wrong). However, the process of exposing clients to traumatic memories is a highly sensitive one and requires extensive training. The process has to be done in a very particular way so as to not make the problems worse. Do the practitioners of TFT have this kind of rigorous training and background knowledge about the nature of PTSD, and how to not worsen it? The thought makes me shudder. Second from my own experience with trauma survivors I know that issues such as forgiveness towards the perpetrator are potentially minefield issues and must be addressed very carefully. Do TFT practitioners understand the issues inherent with the forgiveness for trauma survivors?  
Additionally, when TFT is not successful, its founders claim this is due to such things as the self-sabotoging attitudfes of the clients. This sounds like blaming the victim. It conveniently passes the blame and gets them off the hook/
In stark contrast to Callahan, the creators of respectable psychotherapies that claim effectiveness have gone to great pains to subject their treatment to rigorous scientific scrutiny in order to be able to establish that their treatments work beyond mere placebo effects as listed in the last paragraph. Then these treatments are only conducted by people with licenses and who have undergone extensive additional training. When there are such successful evidence-based treatments available for something such as PTSD, including Prolonged Exposure Therapy and Cognitive Processing Therapy, why mess around with treatments which not only seem implausible in their mechanism of action, but also have no scientific validation to justify their use. 
A former student of Callahan, named Gary Craig has created an offshoot treatment called Emotional Freedom Techniques or EFT. Craig says the particular sequences of how the tapping is done is unimportant as he has observed people do it the wrong way and still have success. He has stated that tapping anywhere on the body will affect the energy meridians. This makes his treatment unfalsifiable. For something to be scientifically tested there must be a way to test whether it works or not. Because EFT cannot be falsified then it is not something that can be considered within the realm of science. These is convenient for practitioners of sham treatments. He takes his claims of what EFT into the realm of medical conditions. Craig uses “surrogate tapping” where there therapist taps on themselves with supposed benefits to the client. 
I visited Craig’s website and watched a video of him speaking about Emotional Freedom Techniques. He describes it as using tapping, a modification of acupuncture to heal people’s emotional problems. Then he goes on to say that emotional problems cause physical disease and that tapping cures these as well. He offers client testimonials that include people claiming to have been cured of conditions such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes with the use of tapping. I felt queasy as I watched this appalling use of marketing manipulation to mislead sick and troubled people towards quackery.
The Skeptic’s Disctionary highlights a Craig quote, “I hope this doesn't sound too grandiose but you just walked into the most successful health innovation in the last 100 years. Based on impressive new discoveries regarding the body's subtle energies, Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT) has been astonishingly successful in thousands of clinical cases. It applies to just about every emotional and physical issue you can name and often works where nothing else will.” Yes, Mr. Craig. This does sound too grandiose. These kinds of claims should trigger skepticism, but undoubtedly many are sucked in. Notice he says clinical “cases” not clinical trials. This is a fancy way of saying there is only anectedotal evidence, or testimonials to support his claims.  
Lilienfeld (1998) has stated that pseudoscientific psychotherapies threaten the welfare of the public. TFT and EFT would qualify as pseudoscience which involves treatments advertised as if they have scientific support when in fact they do not. Thankfully, some regulating boards are taking a stand. For example, the Arizona Board of Psychology suspended a psychologist’s license for refusing to explain how tapping works. The American Psychological Association has prohibited training in tapping as being used for continuing education credit. Also, TFT and EFT are listed on quackwatch.org, a website run by Stephen Barrett, M.D., a psychiatrist and award winning consumer advocate.
Besides the fact that TFT and EFT are not scientifically sound treatments, it disturbs me that they are used to treat mental health conditions by people who are not trained and licensed mental health professionals. People who are not properly trained can do harm when dabbling in things they do not understand. This is why there are years of rigorous training and a licensure process required before people can call themselves mental health professionals. It seems that people practicing TFT and EFTn think it is okay to forgo all of that. Also, why would one want to offer bizarre, non-evidence based treatments for conditions such as phobias when there are well research supported, highly effective treatments already available? For money? Out of ignorance? 
When I think about my own extensive experience working with individuals with PTSD, my knowledge of the complexity of the condition, and knowing the richness of the evidence based treatments for it, I scoff at the idea of someone tapping on imaginary points on someone’s body as a method of treatment. Shame on you the founders and marketers of tapping. Also, shame on you any licensed mental health practitioners who fall for such quackery and then use your authority to submit hurting individuals to it for a fee.  
Possibly the most appalling thing about TFT is that the founders insist on keeping the way it works a secret for proprietary reasons. As mentioned above, they charge massive amounts of money to learn it and then force those who do to sign non-disclosure agreements. It is unethical to make claims that there is such an effective treatment available and then hold its methods a secret. Talk about sketchy! 
The fact that Callahan points to his performances on shows such as Oprah brings to mind another questionable character who was given a public platform on her show, Dr. Oz. One might assume that because Dr. Oz has a medical degree and an academic seat at Columbia University, that his advice is trustworthy. 
Evidence has now publically come to light that much of what Dr. Oz says is blatantly untrue. As stated by Slate.com, Dr. Mehmet Oz may be the “best-known peddler of weight loss scams. When he talks about shedding pounds, his show has attracted more than 3 million viewers. The supplements he hawks have been thoroughly debunked”.  The Slate article includes a video clip of Senator Claire Mckaskill taking Dr. Oz to task on this topic. Yet, sadly as Slate also points out, it is those who most cannot afford these supplements who tend to trust television for advice on health care. On his HBO show, John Oliver points out that Dr. Oz has defended himself by saying that his show title has the word “Dr.” in small print, whereas “Oz” is in large print. This alone should tell viewers that he is not in fact giving out real medical advice and his show is only for entertainment. What a scoundrel. 
On the website Science-Based Medicine, Dr. Gorski has written in detail about the shameful and bad advice given on the Dr. Oz Show. One such example is that it has been revealed that the naturopath Dr. Oz featured on his show promoting green coffee bean extract has been fined $9 million by the Federal Trade Commission because of his failure to disclose his direct financial interest in making the promotion. The naturopath, Lindsey Duncan, not only misrepresented what the supplement can do, but then encouraged consumers to use websites owned by him. Sadly, Duncan then sold $50 million worth of the supplements. Gorski stated that such situations are prevalent on the Dr. Oz Show and that “If you’re trying to sell a supplement, yet you don’t have actual scientific evidence to back up your claims, The Dr. Oz Show is your ticket to recognition and sales”.
Many of us may be skeptical of the fabulously rich television evangelist who tells people to send him their money and God will bless them. But it is tempting to uncritically give yourself over to the claims made of by those with impressive credentials such as “doctor”. Possibly even more so, people believe researchers from prestigious institutions. Someone once told me in defense of the China Study researchers who have been accused of manipulating data, that they the researchers certainly must have the best intentions. I think accepting at face value that researchers can be trusted to be wholeheartedly seeking the truth is unwise because ego, greed, and incompetence can enter into the equation in the research world.  But it is important to be skeptical of all individuals who use their credentials to gain fame and wealth. 
Here is an example. In 2009, Elizabeth Blackburn of the University of California, San Francisco received the Nobel Prize for discovering telomeres. Telomeres are “structures at the ends of all of our chromosomes that are necessary for our cells to divide”. They shorten over time. In a Slate article entitled “Soda ages cells as much as cigarettes: Debunking telomere studies of health and aging”, Daniel Engber highlights how the discovery of telomeres has gained much attention and led some to make unjustified claims about what it means. It has raised questions about whether measuring telemores could provide predictive data about disease and aging. In 2003, researchers at the University of Utah found that the senior citizens they measured who had the shortest telomeres died four or five years earlier than the average of the others they measured. This seemed like a huge discovery. Then a 2010 review of 10 studies found that there was no association with telomere length and death in 5 out of the 10 studies. In 2004, Blackburn and her colleague Elissa Epel conducted a study with a small group of middle-aged women and concluded that “those who experienced very high levels of stress had much shorter telomeres”. Then a more recent study found no evidence of such a relationship. According to a summary of the field from 2013, all that is clear is that as we get older our telomeres get shorter, men have shorter telomeres than women, and whites have shorter telomeres than blacks. However, this conflicting evidence has no deterred Blackburn and Epel from cashing in. They have recently sold a book for $1 million entitled, The Telomere Solution: How the Nobel-Prize-Winning Discovery Can Help You Fight Cellular Aging and Improve Lifelong Health will reveal "how we can keep our cells healthy and dramatically reduce aging by simple diet, exercise, stress-reduction, and psychological techniques, including a way to discover our true biological age.”
In a Science-Based Medicine blog about the recent popularity of telomeres, James Coyne points out it is difficult to sort out what the science actually says from exaggerated claims because some of the claims are coming from researchers with impressive credentials. He stated that typically critical thinkers can sus this out by using the sourcing heuristic. This is something people with expertise in a field will automatically do. It means to check out the credibility of the source by say flipping to the back of a book and looking at things like what university affiliations the author has or who gives recommendations. For example, if I pick up something and see it is recommended by Dr. Oz or Natural News, I will put it back down. But what do you do when claims are being made by researchers who have say won the Nobel Prize like Elizabeth Blackburn? We cannot blindly accept claims made by respected researchers always either. This is because there is a lot of money at stake when it comes to things the public jumps on like the telomere findings. “Patents and products tied to telomeres have obvious commercial potential, but there is also another temptation in that making wild claims could send wannabe bench-to-boardroom researchers flying business class to give five-figure/hour talks to corporations”. 
Gorski also writes that obtaining funding for research can also be a factor leading to bias in research. “Many of the strongest claims about telomere length and health outcomes come from studies that are so small that finding large effects is statistically improbable, even if they are present. This suggests a strong confirmation bias that exploits flexible rules for aggregating and analyzing data, and selective reporting. Bigger epidemiological studies obtain modest, if any, associations with telomere length, while small clinical samples get what appear to be stronger effects with many fewer participants. As Ioannidis has demonstrated, this is typical in hot areas of research: there will be a lot of false discoveries and inflated claims that will not be reproducible when replication is attempted by independent investigator groups in larger, better-designed studies.”
From the perspective of a patient, I find myself asking, whose advice seems more trustworthy than a Nobel prize winner? As I considered examples such as Callahan, Dr. Oz, and Elizabeth Blackburn, I felt concerned for myself as a sick person and for other sick people as we, from our position of vulnerability, try to sort out who we can trust and who we cannot regarding our health. It is confusing and discouraging to consider that there are highly credentialed individuals out there making claims that sound so appealing to those who are frightened and discouraged by illness, yet those credentialed individuals are in fact selling something and their motivation may be driven more by greed than good intentions.
I know that some chronically ill people feel they should give everything a try that is suggested to them. Toni Bernhard, writer of “How to Be Sick”, also writes a blog on chronic illness for Psychology Today. It is called “Turning Straw into Gold”. In her post “Top Ten Health Tips That Have never Worked for Me” she writes about how she has tried many of the suggestions people have given her about healing and they have not worked. She has tried things such as drinking lots of water, taking probiotics, eating vegan, eating paleo, various forms of exercise, uncovering childhood trauma, and even pretending she is not sick. None of these things have healed her. Although it may not hurt to try many the things she has, are there potentially risks or downsides to trying some of the treatments I have been suggested? Should I take a shotgun approach?
My initial reaction to advice given me regarding trying alternative medical treatments was to jump in head first and try it all. I think this was out of desperation and ignorance. When you want something badly enough, such as to be well, it is tempting to cling on to anything that offers hope. Whether it is real or not. Also, when do not have expertise in an area, it is tempting to blindly trust supposed experts. However, when I was encouraged to try tapping, something that fell within my own area of expertise, mental health, I had a very different reaction. My reaction was to see whether there was verification for its claims. This led me to quickly sniff out quackery and dismiss it. This led me to ask myself, why do I not apply the same level of scrutiny to suggested alternative treatments for my physical health? I concluded that if there is such quackery occurring within the field of mental health and I can see its potential destructive effects, and I know there are individuals such as Dr. Oz out there targeting the realm of physical health and medicine, then I better apply some critical thought to alternative treatments for my physical health before investing any time and money.
I began my investigation with some books written by skeptics about the field of alternative medicine in general. 
In his book, “A Scientist in Wonderland”, Edzard Ernst, a medical doctor and scientist who has done prolific research into alternative medicine, writes about his openness to alternative practices, including homeopathy, early in his career. This was because he grew up in Germany where homeopathy was embraced and used right alongside conventional medicine by many physicians. He stated that he observed many patients improve after it was administered. With chronic conditions in particular, he witnessed most patients improve after receiving homeopathy. He was surprised by this as he understood how biologically implausible it was.  Having a questioning mind, he wondered if it was the homeopathy itself or other factors such as the caring attention of the doctors, the expectancy of improvement, or simply the passage of time. His curiosity eventually led him to a career devoted to studying such questions which caused quite a backlash against him. 
During his time spent working primarily with alternative practitioners, he noticed they tended to be the kind of people that could not handle the rigorous demands of conventional medicine. Alternative medicines tend to be theoretically simplistic and not be burdened with demands for scientific proof. He discusses how even amongst conventional physicians there can be a tendency towards simplistic thinking sometimes because they do not have the time to question things like scientists and many cannot be bothered. So there is a tendency to make assumptions about cause and effect relationships. Clinicians are overly likely to assume that whatever treatment they gave is the reason that a patient improves and then pat themselves on the back and move on to the next patient. Scientists have to go beyond this assumptions and recognize that correlation does not mean causation and there may be more to the story. Scientists are trained to scrutinize everything as that is how they get closer to the truth. Ernst states, “An uncritical scientist is a contradiction in terms: if you meet one, chances are that you have encountered a charlatan”.  Even while working as researcher he observed that in some particular academic settings, certain researchers are more interested in pursuing prestige than search for truth. This can lead to bias and even blatant fraud. This is something that the public should keep in mind when hearing about the latest “study”. 
Later in his career he created a research lab at the University of Exeter, England, that focused specifically on testing the claims of alternative medicine. He approached it with an open mind and tried to work with the alternative medicine community as he designed his research. He described his early encounters with large numbers of alternative practitioners and proponents and observing a “strange naivety” and lack of understanding about science. He found them to be “detached from reality”. He described how as they came to realize that he was interested in non-partially putting their beloved world to the test they became hostile. He realized they assumed that he would approach his research from the standpoint of being committed to promoting alternative medicine. He found that most alternative practitioners had no interest in putting their methods to the test. He also came to learn that there was much hostility towards conventional medicine and science itself amongst this community. He summed up his experiences over the two decades he did his research as involving “endless conflicts between my agenda of testing alternative medicine scientifically and the fervent aspirations of enthusiasts to promote alternative medicine uncritically”. 
This resulted in Dr. Ernst being treated with severe hostility, threats, and insults on a regular basis. He reported he had to get used to “an incessant drumbeat of hostile criticism, aggression and even personal attacks”. HE stated many of these were absurd and that the most vocal and determined critics seemed to be the least informed. He even feared for his safety at times. It was not that he was not open to criticism, it was that criticism not based in logic or fact was not useful. HE eventually concluded that “for some alternative medicine zealots, no amount of explanation would ever suffice. To them, alternative medicine seemed to have mutated into a religion, a cult whose central creed must be defended at all costs against the infidel”. HE stated that if one is to apply a critical lens to alternative medicine they will likely be viewed as the “great Satan by those who make their living from it”.
  
He found that much of the research that had previously been conducted into alternative medicine involved unscientific methods such as simply surveying people who chose to pursue and thus pay for alternative treatments about their perceived benefits. Thus, this would be heavily influenced by the known tendency of people to be biased in favor of something they have already invested in. They is because they want to avoid experiencing cognitive dissonance.      
He was accused of taking a reductionist approach by using clinical trials to test alternative medicine. He was told that alternative medicine is too “holistic, subtle, and individual to be assessed by the standard scientific methodology”. He disagreed by retorting that those who use such an argument do not understand what science can do and likely fear being exposed as quacks. He asserted that the clinical trial is the best research tool we have to get at the truth and that there was no good reason why alternative treatments could not be tested and determined to be effective or not. The value of the clinical trial is that if designed well it allows non-specific effects to be controlled so that the treatment alone is being tested. This is done with the use of randomization, blinding, and placebo controls. Then in addition to good clinical trials, the truth of a subject is best determined by a systematic review. This involves reviewing in an unbiased way, all the published studies on a subject. This helps to avoid cherry picking, or focusing on studies that support one’s agenda while ignoring those which don’t. 
During his time at Exeter, Ernst’s team published about 40 clinical trials and 300 systematic reviews. His conclusions were that “most alternative therapies are not nearly as effective as enthusiasts tried to make us believe”. He also concluded that other researchers in his field had no “real intention to ever seriously question their assumptions or truly test their concepts”. They tended to conduct simple surveys so as to not upset anyone or be so biased by their own agenda that they set up their trials in a way that would ensure a positive result. 
One major reason Dr. Ernst pursued rigorous testing of alternative treatments was due to concerns over their safety. He discussed how many people who use alternative treatments tend to assume that natural equals safe. When in fact nature creates things such as deadly nightshade. He also tested them for efficacy and cost. He argues that “patients and consumers have an absolute right to know the truth about the value of the treatments they frequently use”. Ernst argued that his research provided information that could help steer away from treatments that worked merely through placebo towards those that are demonstrated to work. Those treatments that were found effective should be no longer called “alternative” and should be just considered to be “medicine”. 
Additionally, Ernst stated that he has concerns about ways alternative medicine threatens public health. One risk with pursuing alternative medicine is that it can be life threatening if one in fact has a serious and treatable illness. He noted with concern that some alternative medicine practitioners do not refer people with life threatening conditions for the treatments they actually need. A journalist friend of his went undercover to five alternative medicine practitioners pretending to have lymphatic cancer (highly treatable but otherwise deadly cancer) who all recommended unproven treatments. If he had followed their advice he would have died. 
He writes that in recent decades, science has come under threat. This is because in our relativist, postmodern culture, there are many truths and they are all valid. This environment has helped alternative medicine grow in popularity as it is not required to demonstrate that it is supported by solid reasoning. The “ad populum” fallacy comes into play. If many use it, then it must be safe and effective. However, we know the masses can be wrong. Bloodletting and other dangerous and ineffective treatments have been widely used in the past. And then there is the post hoc fallacy. This is the assumption that if one event follows another in time, then the former event caused the latter. Thus, if we pursue and alternative treatment and improve we might assume it is because of the alternative treatment when in fact it could be many other things.      
Proponents of alternative medicine sometimes portray themselves as more compassionate than conventional practitioners. However, compassion should be present throughout the healthcare system. He stated that the many “smokescreens” used to argue for alternative medicine “constitute an attack upon rationality and a treason against progress in health care”. 
Sometimes people with fame or status advocate alternative treatments. This can be confusing, particularly if they have prestige associated with their name, such as having won a Nobel Prize. However, Ernst points out this is not proof of anything. Well-educated people and powerful institutions can sometimes “commit the silliest and most obvious of mistakes”.   
After finding through his research that benefits experienced through spiritual healing, such as energy work, was entirely due to placebo effects, Ernst worried about whether to reveal this to the public. This is because he had concerns that once this information was known, the people would no longer experience the benefits. However, he and his team opted for reporting the truth. He states that factors that cause placebo, or non-specific effects, such as clinicians providing sufficient “time, dedication, compassion, and empathy” are “useful’ they can never a sufficient reason for using placebos in place of established treatments”. This is because the patient would then miss out on the benefits of an effective treatment. I think this arguments seems obviously true; however what about when conventional medicine has no effective and safe treatments to offer? Another argument against using treatments that are no more than placebo is that alternative medicine can have adverse side effects. But what about treatments that have been shown to be safe, such as acupuncture? More about this later.
R. Barker Bausell’s book, “Snake Oil Science: The Truth about Complementary and Alternative Medicine” also provides a critique of alternative medicine and the supposed science used to justify it. Many of the same concerns emerge that were addressed by Ernst. Bausell is a research methodologist and thus specializes in critiquing the quality of scientific studies. Bausell states that we believe in things for various reasons including “because we want to, because we need to, because certain beliefs fit our worldviews or religious tenets”, because others we know do, or because it is supported by our own experience. However, Bausell also states that all these justifications for belief can be misleading. 
One impediment to correctly assessing the cause of things is the very human difficulty with admitting when we are wrong. Psychologists call this cognitive dissonance. We tend to distort the truth in our minds so that it fits with our cherished beliefs. Another is our optimism. We want to believe there is something that will fix us. Yet another is our blind trust of authority figures. Additional there is what Bausell calls a “national enquirer approach to life”. That is the tendency of some to believe in the absurd. Bausell suspects this may be due to a desire to believe in “wondrous occurrences”. Finally, there is a lack of skepticism in some people. This is present in people who are too trusting and do not question. 
One major way people are misled is when they assume that because something improved (i.e. pain) after something else (visit to acupuncturist), then it was the trip to the acupuncturist that did it. When in fact many other factors may be responsible for the improvement. One major one is that the majority of symptoms we experience go away on their own. This is called spontaneous remission. Another factor to consider is that many conditions have an ebb and flow of symptoms. People tend to go to get treatment during a flare up and then attribute the easing of symptoms to the treatment they got when in fact it was due to the natural waning of symptoms. 
Other misleading factors that may be due to the visit to the alternative healer, but in fact are not due to the effectiveness of their treatment include the healing that can occur simply from the kind attention of the healer or from the placebo effect. 
By contrast, he emphasizes that science offers the most reliable way we to ascertain the truth about things through its ability to assess cause and effect relationships with the use of controlled experiments. However, designing a high quality study is extremely difficult. Even the gold standard of quality research, “randomized, placebo-controlled trials can be worse than useless unless they are conducted very, very carefully under the best of circumstances”. This is because many factors can get in the way and lead to studies that appear to support the researcher’s hypothesis and yet are flawed. Examples of such factors are the limitations of the humans conducting the study such as their level of competence, the degree to which their own biases blind them, and their ethics or lack thereof. The ebb and flow of chronic conditions can also confuse study results as can a statistical phenomenon called regression to the mean. That is, if the research participant’s symptoms are unusually high or low at the beginning of the study then their scores will change over time to become closer to their average score. Also, it can be tempting for researchers who have devoted so much time to a study to convince themselves that it is okay to subtly tweak the report of their findings so that they get positive results. 
Other obstacles relate to the research participant’s behavior. The results of a study can be influenced by factors such as whether they want to please the researcher, whether they can detect if they are in a placebo group or not (it is very difficult to blind participants to this), or whether they leave the study early because they are not improving, thus skewing the results. 
Bausell asserts that the majority of research done on complementary and alternative medicine is not the high quality kind. For example, Bausell states that it is estimated that “more than 500 randomized controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate acupuncture alone, half of which have been placebo-controlled, yet the number of high-quality acupuncture trials could probably be counted on one’s fingers.” Additionally, to ensure a study’s findings were not the result of random luck, they must be replicated by other scientists. However, this is rarely done in complementary and alternative medicine research. 
To confuse matters more, Bausell claims that studies reported in complementary and alternative medicine journals are suspect because such journals have a clear bias. Even more confusing, some of the most prestigious journals are permitting researchers publishing on complementary and alternative medicine to present their findings as positively supporting a treatment when in fact the results suggest it was no different than placebo. 
Bausell concludes that the best way to protect ourselves from misleading study results is to assess for a study’s credibility. The most credible studies are large (at least 50 participants per group), “double-blinded randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with low experimental attrition published in high-quality scientific journals that have been independently validated by other investigators”. However, Bausell also pointed out that there are many people who do not care about such credibility because they care more about preserving their beliefs than whether their beliefs are accurate. 
Bausell wrestled with whether to write his book. Because so many people believe they are benefitting from alternative treatments he wondered whether he should rock the boat. However, he concluded that the issue must be highlighted because of multiple factors. People are using these treatments in growing numbers, in large part due to conventional medicine’s ineffectiveness at treating common chronic conditions. Alternative treatments are increasingly being encouraged by prestigious institutions such as Harvard Medical School and the National Institutes of Health which patients often believe they can trust. Bausell concluded that most people want to know the truth about whether a treatment they are using actually works. Also, he personally believes, as do I, that it is best to choose knowledge and truth over delusion. 
The overall conclusion of his book is that the benefits observed by those who study and use complementary and alternative medicine is almost entirely due to the workings of the placebo effect. 
The writings of Bausell and Ernst certainly raise my levels of skepticism towards alternative treatments to a very high degree. As you will see in the next chapter, I next moved on to considering specific treatments I had been recommended.



Chapter Four Alternative Treatments
As I began trying to learn more about the particular alternative treatments recommended to me by friends and family members, I found that for some of them, it seems clear that they are either bogus or dangerous. However, for some the research is complex and seemingly contradictory. I have included what I discovered below. The purpose of including this is more to show how confusing it can be as a patient to try to get informed and make wise decisions about alternative treatments than to present what I found as if it is a thorough and complete review on each subject. I am not an expert in any of these alternative treatments. I am just a patient trying to make sense of them and wanted to share my process and at least encourage others to ask questions before making blind leaps. 
Ayurvedic medicine:
A highly educated friend of mine, whom I respect immensely, suggested I attend an Ayurvedic retreat. Intrigued (and desperate), I looked at some websites about such retreat centers. The presentation on the websites was alluring. I recognized treatments such as yoga and meditation as something I can fully support. Although other treatments sounded strange, the idea of giving myself over to some mystical sounding gurus in a beautiful setting was appealing. Of course I did a little more research.
Web MD says that Ayurvedic medicine “is one of the world's oldest holistic (whole-body) healing systems. It was developed thousands of years ago in India”. Sounds impressive so far, I thought. Recommended Related to Mind, Body, SpiritDe-Junk Your LifeI read onBy Anna Davies How to understand (and then unload!) the clutter that drags you down. Have you ever found yourself gazing longingly at the spare and tidy living rooms, kitchens, and home offices in a furniture catalog and wishing you could live in that world? No mess, everything neatly in its place — it's a setup that would last, oh, approximately seven seconds here on planet Earth! Fact is, you have a big, hectic, possibly messy real life — a life that you'll enjoy a lot more.... “Read the De-Junk Your Life article > >A main goal of Ayurvedic medicine is to cleanse your body of undigested food called ama, which can stick to the inside of your body and make you sick.” Huh? It goes on to say that this cleansing process is called panchakarma and may include things such as blood purification, inducing vomiting, and the use of enemas, laxatives, or purgatives to cleanse your intestines. Do my intestines need cleansing?
I then looked at the cost involved with one example, The Raj Maharishi Ayurveda Health Spa, Fairfield, Iowa, USA. A three day Panchakarma rejuvenation program is $2186.00 per person including room, meals, Ayurvedic physician’s consultations, yoga classes, Ayurvedic cooking classes, daily treatments, health coaching, and lectures. The VIP Veda Intensive program costs $1150.00 per day. For this kind of cash I wanted to know a little about the research support for such treatment. Would I be getting anything substantial for that kind of money?
So, then I looked for evidence of research support for such treatments. Web MD states that “Recently, scientists have reported that Ayurveda may be a valuable tool in managing obesity and diabetes. However, a Cochrane review found there is insufficient evidence to recommend Ayurveda for the routine treatment of diabetes.” It also indicated that the FDA has warned that one in five Ayurvedic medicines contain toxic metals, including: lead, mercury, and arsenic. Web MD cites a study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found that several Indian-manufactured Ayurvedic products could "result in lead and/or mercury ingestions 100 to 100,000 times greater than acceptable limits." Lead, mercury, and arsenic are heavy metals. They can cause life-threatening illness, especially in children.
Yikes! 
In “Trick or Treatment”, Simon Singh writes that “Ayurvedic healthcare is a complex system that cannot be easily evaluated. The current evidence suggests that some of its elements (such as yoga) are effective while many others are essentially untested, or overtly dangerous, e.g. many herbal preparations”. The information I have described above was enough for me to make an easy decision on the subject of Ayurvedic Medicine. I have been practicing yoga for years and will continue to do so. However, I will steer clear of the rest of the system and certainly not pay thousands of dollars to go to a retreat where I may potentially be not only wasting money, but be harmed. 
Functional Medicine:
The same friend mentioned above also recommended that I see a functional medicine specialist. Again as I looked into this treatment approach, I was struck by the financial expense involved. You must pay out of pocket to see a functional medicine specialist. They will bill your insurance; however insurance may pay nothing or a small portion of the costs. For me, there are no FM practitioners in my area. I would have to travel two hours to see one. So for this kind of time and expense I wanted to know more about it. Going to see my local doctor is exhausting due to my illness. Traveling to see a doctor is overwhelming. Additionally, I am living on tiny disability checks. These are the kinds of factors facing a sick person when they are considering their options and why for me I can’t try things willy nilly. 
One tool that I use when I want to consider possible questionable aspects of a particular alternative medicine practice is the website Science-Based Medicine. This website is “dedicated to evaluating medical treatments and products of interest to the public in a scientific light, and promoting the highest standards and traditions of science in health care.” Dr. Gorski, MD, Ph.D, FACS, is one of the site contributors. He is a surgical oncologist and an Associate Professor of Surgery and Oncology at the Wayne State University School of Medicine. The following comments are made by David Gorski on the subject of functional medicine.
“Functional medicine is pure pseudoscience”… “It postulates “imbalances” in hormones and neurotransmitters, oxidation-reduction, detoxification and biotransformation, immune function, inflammation, and cell structure. It’s all so vague that these “imbalances” could mean almost anything, and when practitioners of “functional medicine” refer to them, they usually do.” Functional medicine practitioners claim to offer individualized treatment.  Gorski states that this means “making it up as you go along” and “whatever the practitioner wants it to mean”. 
These comments in addition to the rest of his blog on the topic pretty much zapped my motivation to pay out big bucks and inconvenience myself traveling to see one of these types of doctors. 
Detoxifying:
The writings of Ben Goldacre, M.D., physician, academic and science writer, are another resource I consider when wanting to turn a critical eye onto alternative medicine practices. In his book, “Bad Science” he has explored such treatments as detoxification. He asked the question, what are these supposed toxins? He stated, “I’ve asked the manufacturers of many detox products this question time and time again, but they demur. They wave their hands, they talk about stressful modern lifestyles, they talk about pollution, they talk about junk food, but they will not tell me the name of a single chemical that I can measure.” 
He points out that a pattern he has observed within the pseudo-sciences is a tendency to avoid addressing criticisms by setting up untestable positions. He also stated that some detox products are advertised to have experiments done that prove they work. However, “they don’t tell you what these experiments consisted of, or what their “methods” were.” He also highlights that another aspect of pseudoscience involves “the invention of a whole new physiological process. In terms of basic human biochemistry, detox is a meaningless concept.” He goes on to say that over time poor diet or other lifestyle choices take a toll on the body; however quick fix solutions like detox are not the answer because they are not “based in science”. 
Another resource I have turned to in my pursuit of truth regarding alternative treatments is Simon Singh and Edzard Ernst’s book “Trick or Treatment”. Singh is a physicist and science writer. Ernst is a physician and academic who has extensively researched alternative medicine. In “Trick or Treatment” they write that the concept of detox as it is used in alternative medicine, is a “scam” and that it has never been demonstrated to actually be able to do what it claims to do. The authors suggest instead that drinking water, exercising, resting and eating well will “rapidly normalize the body after a period of over-indulgence”. They state that the only thing alternative medicine detox therapies remove is your money.
Good enough for me.
Nutrition/extreme diets:
I spent more time on this topic than some others because I have family members and friends whose health has certainly improved. Each of them have attributed this improvement primarily to one of several particular extreme diets. One claims the paleo diet has healed them. One claims that the vegan diet has healed them. Another claims that an anti-inflammatory diet has drastically improved their medical condition. I find this particularly confusing because the paleo and vegan diets are basically opposites. One claims meat is good, gluten is bad. One claims meat is bad, gluten is good. Because of these seeming contradictions and because these diets involve eliminating entire food groups (which is hard), I decided to try and learn more before making any drastic changes to my own diet (basically a healthy, but not extreme one already).  
My father has radically improved his health since becoming vegan. He also has vigorously exercised throughout his life. At this point in his life, he is energetic and feels great.
Diet certainly plays a significant role in prevention of conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. But can diet changes so radically improve other conditions, such as mine? 
Several contributors have commented about the subject of diet on the website Science-Based Medicine. In a blog on cancer, contributor Dr. Gorski discusses how adamantly some in the “diet cult” community claim that embracing their diet can prevent or cure things such as cancer when the research does not in fact support this. Writer Harriet Hall has highlighted how authors of the famous China Study and writers on the blog NutritionFacts.Org have made sweeping claims about how plant based diets or veganism can prevent all disease. In her blogs “The China Study Revisited” and “Death as a Foodborne Illness Curable by Veganism” Hall pointed out how these claims are not supported by the evidence. She described how Michael Greger, M.D. of Nutritionfacts.org and T. Colin Campbell of the China Study do things such as cherry pick data to support their agendas, ignore conflicting evidence, and site poor sources. This means that the authors choose data from their own research or report only on studies that seem to support their argument without providing a complete view of the picture. 
When this is done, the public hears things like “one study said that…” or “we found a correlation between…….” and conclude, “Enough said!” However, in the research world, “one study” doesn’t mean a whole lot because it might be contradicted by others which say the opposite. Such conflicting results may relate to findings found by random chance, to poor study design, or to the influence of researcher bias. This is why sources such as the Cochrane Collaboration are so important. The Cochrane Collaboration is an online tool that includes systematic reviews of research topics. They look at all the studies on a topic, eliminate those of poor quality, and then draw conclusions. 
In contrast to this excellent source is the questionable reporting of Michael Greger, M.D. He claims on his website, Nutritionfacts.org to “scour the world’s nutrition research to bring you daily videos and articles”. Harriet Hall highlights one of his videos which she was browbeaten into watching by a vegan friend. In the video, Greger claims that “Death in America is largely a foodborne illness”. Hall writes that she often encounters “people who have been overwhelmed by the information presented in a video that supports their beliefs. They assume that the evidence presented is incontrovertible, and that anyone who agreed to watch it would necessarily be converted to their beliefs.” She stated this is in part because the information is being presented by a charismatic scientist. Hall stated that in his video he shows a table listing “the leading causes of death and goes through them one by one, presenting his evidence that a diet devoid of animal-based foods can prevent and cure each of them”. Hall then goes on to counter his arguments on each disease showing a tendency to cite “flawed research”, cite studies with no control groups, draw conclusions far beyond what certain studies actually showed, draw conclusions actually warned against drawing by the studies’ authors, and not report on studies that show contradictory data. Hall then goes on to cite numerous studies that contradict Greger’s claims. Hall cites research which shows the average 70-year-old Inuit with a traditional diet of whale and seal has arteries as elastic as that of a 20-year-old Danish resident. Hall also points out that factors other than elimination of animal products from the diet might explain the benefits observed in the vegan diet. The vegan diet is associated with weight loss and it could be the weight loss alone that explains health improvements, particularly reductions in diabetes. She also suggests that it could be the increase in fruit and vegetable intake that accompanies vegan diets that explains health improvements. 
In regards to researchers making sweeping claims about their own research, they may be making causative statements about mere correlations. Or they may highlight one significant correlation they found that supports their argument and fail to acknowledge that their data actually showed other correlations that contradicted their argument. For example, as Hall points out, T. Colin Campbell of the China Study makes strong claims in support of a vegan diet. He highlights that his research found positive associations between plasma cholesterol and cancer mortality. His data also indicated that plasma cholesterol was positively associated with animal protein and negatively associated with plant protein. Campbell then makes the leap to conclude that animal protein causes cancer mortality. However, this is a leap and is misleading. A review of his data done by Denise Minger revealed that the variable “Death from all cancers” is four times as strongly associated with plant protein as with animal protein. Campbell says dietary fat is associated with breast cancer. However, the data actually shows a non-significant association. He reports animal protein is associated with higher rates of cardiovascular disease. However, he ignores that his data shows that cardiovascular disease is more associated with higher levels of plant protein. Minger asserts that the China Study data actually contradicts Campbell’s conclusions. It instead supports that animal protein does not correspond with more disease. Minger’s writings reveal many more indications of such misrepresentation. She concludes that “I believe Campbell was influenced by his own expectations about animal protein and disease, leading him to seek out specific correlations in the China Study data (and elsewhere) to confirm his predictions”.
Matt Fitzgerald is an athlete, sports writer, and nutritionist. In his book, “Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of Us”, author states that rules about food have been with humanity throughout its history. He stated this may have begun as a way for information about what is safe to eat and what is not to be transmitted. However, then an association between eating and morality developed as a way for groups of people to distinguish themselves from others and create a sense of group cohesion. He asserts that the popularity of current extreme diets such as the Paleo diet are no exception. He stated that the healthy diet cults win followers by appealing to the heart not to reason. He states that people want to feel they belong to a group and following an extreme diet is a way of doing this. He stated people choose one particular diet because it fits with some aspect of their identity.  He provided the example of a man who became vegan because his personality was drawn to extremes. He then cherry-picked what he read in order to support his belief and “It feels good to believe in something”. 
Fitzgerald states that there are myths that all the healthy-diet cults share including that “human nutrition is perfectible, the notion that some foods and nutrients are absolutely bad, others absolutely good, and the assumption that diet is relevant only to physical health”. He states that the healthy-diet cults recruit by claiming their diet is the “One True Way” to eat most healthfully and each diet claims to have scientific evidence to support this. 
However, Fitzgerald argues that “science has not identified the healthiest way to eat”. He states that “science has established quite definitively that humans are able to thrive equally well on a variety of diets. Adaptability is the hallmark of man as eater. For use, many diets are good while none is perfect”. He stated that there is agreement amongst mainstream nutrition scientists about a set of flexible guidelines for healthy eating. These are supported by large epidemiological studies and validated in major scientific reviews. These include familiar basics such as “eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables daily, eat whole grains instead of refined grains, eat fish at least twice a week, avoid sugary drinks, and so forth”. Despite this, Fitzgerald argues that diet cults attract people because “people believe what they want to believe”. 
He also argues for the falseness of healthy diet cult’s claims by reviewing the rapid adaptation of humans to widely varying diets throughout history which was done as a means of survival as they spread across the globe. He argues that history shows humans are capable of living successfully on many different types of diets, thus, there is no good argument that one diet is the correct one. He provides an interesting example of human’s adaptability to varying diets by reviewing the food consumed by the Lewis and Clark party as it made its way across the United States. The men went through periods where they could find nothing but meat and others when they were mostly vegetarian. They were given camas root by the Nez Perce tribe and the men developed stomach pains because the root contained indigestible fibers. However, when they were fed camas root again months later, they ate it without a problem. This is because their digestive tracts changed after being exposed to camas root. Despite the limitations in food available that Lewis and Clark dealt with, they arrived in St Louis in 1806, healthy.
Fitzgerald reviews the problems with many different healthy-diet cults, such as the Paleo diet. The Paleo diet professes that the path to optimal health is to eat exclusively the same foods as humans of the Stone Age. This is because food advances such as grains, legumes and dairy since that time are too new to our DNA. Evolutionary biologists have spoken up to discredit this claim such as by stating that we do not know how much meat was eaten in the paleo era, that there is evidence they did eat grains and legumes, and that most of what they ate does not exist today. Also, in conflict with the Paleo diet, Fitzgerald cites studies that point to the health benefits of dairy and whole grains and the harm associated with eating red meat.
He stated that although “healthy-diet cults are based on false doctrine, most of them are able to deliver the results that their followers seek”. This is because eating healthfully is hard and the diet cults offer motivation through the drive for group belonging. Fitzgerald offers an alternative. He points to his experience working with endurance athletes, an extremely healthy group. He stated they tend to follow mainstream nutrition advice. They eat “everything, but they eat a lot more of the healthiest foods (such as vegetables) then they do of the least healthy foods (such as soft drinks). Using guidelines set by mainstream nutrition science, Fitzgerald proposes what he calls Agnostic Healthy Eating. This involves basically eating more of what is known to be good for us by nutrition science and less of what is not. Thus, all things can be consumed but at varying amounts. He states this is not another diet cult as he does not claim it is the “One True Way”. However, he believes it offers an easy way of following healthy guidelines.
Bad Science: Ben Goldacre writes in Bad Science, “The most important take-home message with diet and health is that anyone who ever expresses anything with certainty is basically wrong, because the evidence for cause and effect in this area is almost always weak and circumstantial”.  
 In “Bad Science”, Ben Goldacre, M.D., discusses the flood of information about nutrition that the public receives via what he calls “media nutritionists”. He accuses the field of nutrition in general of tending to “extrapolate wildly from laboratory bench data to make claims about humans; they extrapolate from observational data to make intervention claims they cherry-pick and last, they quote published scientific research evidence that seems, as far as one can tell, not to exist”. He goes on to say that he is not accusing them of lying because nutritionists “lack the academic experience, the ill will, and perhaps even the intellectual horsepower necessary to be fairly derided as liars”. 
Goldacre provides examples of specific individuals making claims on the news about nutrition and then points out that there is no such evidence available to support these claims. He also discusses how specific media popular nutritionists make causal claims based on merely observational data from epidemiological studies not controlled experiments. This is misleading because it does not control for confounding variables. Although two things might be related statistically, one may not cause the other. There may be some other factor that is in fact the cause that was not considered. 
Additionally, to sound like serious scientists, nutritionists take laboratory findings and leap to falsely confident conclusions about what this can tell us about what the lab findings means for humans. 
Goldacre also accuses the field of nutrition of often claiming things like “a placebo-controlled randomized control trial has shown benefits from a particular vitamin”, when what they mean is it showed changes in a surrogate outcome. This means there was a change observed in something only theoretically proposed to relate to the actual disease being discussed. For example, a trial may have merely shown something like that when you take a particular vitamin, increased amounts of it show up in your bloodstream and nothing more. 
As I mentioned earlier, turmeric was recommended to me as something that would boost my energy. Goldacre discusses how media nutritionists have misrepresented what turmeric can do in the area of cancer prevention. Although one nutritionist has said that turmeric is “highly protective against many forms of cancer”, in fact the findings related to turmeric and cancer have only been conducted on animals. This is a far cry from establishing its effects on humans. Goldacre stated that Austin Bradford Hill, whom is considered the grandfather of modern medical research has laid out a set of guidelines that should be present to assess causality: “it needs to be a strong association, which is consistent, and specific to the thing you are studying, where the putative cause comes before the supposed effect in time; ideally there should be a biological gradient, such as a dose-response effect; it should be consistent or at least not completely at odds with what is already known (because extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence); and it should be biologically plausible”.  Goldacre says that regarding turmeric and cancer, only the last guideline is met. He stated claims are often made based on such tenuous grounds by those who have a financial interest in making the claim. 
Goldacre also points out that cherry-picking data is something commonly done in the field of nutritionism.  That is, the vast and often contradictory world of published medical academic articles is scoured and only those articles which support one’s agenda are selected and reported upon. A more trustworthy approach is to look at systematic reviews. These are when you have an “explicit search strategy for seeking out data (openly described in your paper, even including the search terms you used on databases of research papers), you tabulate the characteristics of each study you find, you measure-ideally blind to the results-the methodological quality of each one (to see how much of a fair test it is), you compare alternatives, and then finally you give a critical, weighted summary”.  The gold standard in this area is the work done by the Cochrane Collaboration. 
Goldacre discusses one specific area the field of nutrition has made claims about, that is the claim that we should consume more antioxidants. He stated there was some support for this provided in 1981 by the epidemiologist, Richard Peto, who reported on studies that seemed to show that beta-carotene reduced cancer risk and that Vitamin E appeared to be associated with lowering heart disease. However, two large studies were conducted after this. One showed that there was more long cancer and more deaths overall from lung cancer and heart disease amongst those receiving beta-carotene supplements than those in the placebo group. The other study looked at people at high risk of lung cancer. It found that those given antioxidant tablets were 46 percent more likely to die from lung cancer than those in the placebo group. Most of us have probably heard about this issue already as it is old news. However, this makes me wonder about what other claims made about nutrition and health in the news will one day be found to be not only unsupported, but harmful. Adding another layer of concern, Goldacre states that we may not always get the message about such issues because the fifty-billion-dollar food supplement industry tends to try to undermine studies that threaten its income. 
Because of all that is described above, Goldacre calls the field of nutritionism, “a crude, unsophisticated, old-fashioned, and above all, reductionist tradition”.    
One way to avoid being misleaded by cherry picking is to read systematic reviews on health topics. So, I looked at the Cochrane Collaboration website to see what they said about diet. I initially entered the search word, “diet” and found 232 reviews. This was too cumbersome to go through and tended to look at specific diets for specific conditions. However, just glancing at the first four that came up was interesting. 
* “the impact of a calorie-controlled diet on the signs and symptoms of asthma in the general asthmatic population is yet to be established.”
* “There is no evidence from RCTs to show an effect of low GI diets on coronary heart disease.”
* “There is currently no firm evidence of the long-term (at least six months) effects of low-fat diets for otherwise healthy people with acquired, that is not familial hypercholesterolaemia (high cholesterol levels in the blood).”
* “Interventions aimed at increasing exercise combined with diet are able to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high risk groups (people with impaired glucose tolerance or the metabolic syndrome).”
I was interested in the first one because I have recently developed asthma and my father claims that a vegan diet has enabled him to get off all his asthma medications. The second and third ones surprised me as I had assumed that the relationship between diet and such conditions as heart disease and high cholesterol was clearly established. The fourth one fit with what I already believed, that diabetes is one of those health conditions that is clearly affected by diet.
I tried to hone in on more specific questions I had, such as the health benefits of a vegetarian or vegan diet, which seems the most plausible to me. This is what came up:
* “The effects of dietary manipulation, including vegetarian, Mediterranean, elemental and elimination diets, on rheumatoid arthritis are still uncertain due to the included studies being small, single trials with moderate to high risk of bias.”
I don’t have arthritis, but I do have inflammatory problems. I tried searching specifically for fatigue which is one of my primary symptoms and found nothing of significance. In summary, the majority of reviews regarding diet and specific health conditions that I did view indicated that overall there is little clarity in the area. If you are reading this book and have a specific health condition and are curious about whether there is substantial support for how it is effected by diet, you may want to do a specific search on Cochrane’s website.
Turning yet to other critical sources, on the Science Blog, Respectful Insolence, Dr. David Gorski writes (under the name, “Orac”) that the naturalistic fallacy and fallacy of antiquity are assumptions that run strong within alternative medicine. These are the beliefs that natural is always better and that people were better off, including healthier before the industrial and agricultural revolutions. Proponents of the Paleo diet profess this. However Gorski discusses research that has shown that atherosclerotic disease was found amongst mummies studied from numerous geographic areas who consumed a wide range of diets, even hunter-gatherers. 
In “Trick or Treatment”, Simon Singh lists numerous alternative diets ranging from those that sound to be on the fringe such as the “Ama-reducing diet (Ayurvedic diet to burn off accumulated ama, which are supposed toxins)” to more mainstream sounding diets such as the “McDougall diet (vegetarian diet, low fat, whole foods)”.  Singh states that there is little data available on these diets and what is available is “usually seriously flawed”. The authors conclude that “alternative diets are burdened with the risk of malnutrition and have not been shown to be effective for any condition. Our advice is to stay well clear of them”.
 Well, after considering all I have summarized above, I could not find any reason to significantly change my diet. As I said, I already have what I consider to be a healthy diet. I try to eat whole foods as much as possible and lots of fruit and veggies. I minimize sugar, refined flour, and red meat. I have found that if I eat sugar excessively I feel terrible. However, I don’t entirely avoid these things. I did try to experiment with minimizing dairy at one point and ended up with chronic diarrhea. So, I think I will keep doing what I have been doing. 
Acupuncture:
After developing migraine headaches in my early 20s I completed 10 sessions of acupuncture and noticed a dramatic decrease in both the frequency and intensity of my migraines. For many years this led me to assume that acupuncture works. However, upon later reflection I realized that the point in time when I completed the acupuncture was similar to when I made other changes in my life. This leaves me uncertain as to what extent it was the acupuncture that helped. Others in my life have suggested I try it again for my current situation. So, as with other suggestions, I investigated further. I found that acupuncture is an area of hot debate with seemingly no end in sight. Just when I thought I had read enough to make a decision, I would find something else that confused the issue. You will see what I mean if you keep reading.  
The person who suggested I try acupuncture for my condition, made two arguments in support of it. One was that if thousands of people in the East have used it for centuries, it must be valid. In “Trick or Treatment”, Singh & Ernst counter this argument by discussing how in the West bloodletting was considered a valid medical treatment for many conditions until clinical trials showed it was not and was actually dangerous. It is presumed that the treatment likely caused the death of George Washington. Bloodletting was in fact used on sailors with scurvy before a ship’s doctor conducted one of the first clinical trials and discovered citrus fruit cured the illness.  So, just because something has been around for a long time, does not make it valid.
The other argument I was given was that just because western medicine does not yet understand acupuncture, doesn’t mean it doesn’t work. Well, as described below, I have since learned that acupuncture has actually been exhaustively researched in the West. For example, when I searched the Cochrane Collaboration’s website I found over 40 systematic reviews of research conducted on acupuncture and various conditions. I will discuss them further later on. Let me say more about some of the different voices within the debate. 
Those on the anti-acupuncture side of the debate all conclude that acupuncture is mere placebo and that evidence used in support of acupuncture is typically misleading and flawed. For example, in “Trick or Treatment”, Singh & Ernst write that acupuncture became popular in the West in the early 1970s after dramatic news reports about how acupuncture was being used in place of anesthetic during surgeries in China. It was later revealed that this had been a hoax and that the Chinese were actually using strong medications on the patients in addition to acupuncture. 
Singh & Ernst summarize their review of the literature about acupuncture and conclude the following points: there is no evidence at all to support the presence of Ch’i or meridians, the supposed mechanism of action in acupuncture; a massive amount of clinical trials testing acupuncture have been conducted and those with positive results have been found to be of poor quality; high-quality trials of acupuncture have shown it does not work beyond placebo for most conditions tested; for those few that have seemed positive, they have been also deemed inconclusive. Singh stated that the more researchers improve the quality of the studies of acupuncture, the more it is revealed that it is merely a placebo treatment. 
In Snake Oil Science, Bausell reports on a study in which he collaborated with Dr. Lixing Lao, an associate professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine who had also been trained in Chinese medicine. They conducted a very high quality study on acupuncture as analgesic following dental surgery. The study included 120 patients, random assignment, and three groups. The first group received traditional acupuncture. The other two groups received slightly different forms of sham acupuncture. The main purpose of the study was to develop and utilize a “perfect” placebo so that the research subjects could not distinguish it from the real therapy and it had absolutely no independent effect of its own. Their results were that “there was no statistically significant difference between the real acupuncture group and the two placebo groups with respect to the average pain experienced following dental surgery”. Additionally, they assessed for whether the participants were able to guess which group they had been in. They concluded that the sham acupuncture was “fairly good” at tricking the participants. Interestingly, those who believed they were getting traditional acupuncture reported a greater reduction in pain than those who believed they were receiving a placebo. 
An example of a respectable researcher on the pro-side who says that acupuncture does work is Robert M. Sapolsky of Stanford University. He states in “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” that acupuncture works for pain by stimulating the release of large quantities of endogenous opioids. He states there are experiments in which a drug is used to block the opiate receptor. Then acupuncture no longer dulls the perception of pain. 
I discovered a formal debate between pro-acupuncture researchers and the editors of the blog Science-Based Medicine on the efficacy of acupuncture. It was included in the journal Anesthesia & Analgesia (2013?). The pro-acupuncture article, written by Wang, Harris, Lin and Gan concluded that “clinical trials support the efficacy of acupuncture in reducing PONV and postoperative pain; however, evidence supporting acupuncture as a treatment for chronic pain conditions is mixed. It should be noted that acupuncture trials in chronic pain have concluded that acupuncture treatment is often superior to standard of care or wait list controls and that acupuncture has minimal side effects and is cost effective.” They end with “Overall, acupuncture practice should not be seen as a placebo intervention or merely a needle therapy, but a medical option that not only treats disorders but also fosters a greater awareness of how harmonic interactions between self, family, work, and environment play a role in promoting health and restoring order.”
David Colquhoun, Ph.D and Steven Novella, MD wrote the con-acupuncture article. They concluded that “acupuncture does not work” and is a “theatrical placebo”. They stated that “It is clear from meta-analyses that results of acupuncture trials are variable and inconsistent, even for single conditions.” Also, “Since it has proved impossible to find consistent evidence after more than 3000 trials, it is time to give up”. And, “A small excess of positive results after thousands of trials is most consistent with an inactive intervention. The small excess is predicted by poor study design and publication bias”. They ended with the statement that acupuncture will likely continue to be used as a “voluntary self-imposed tax on the gullible”.
Another Science-Based Medicine contributor who has much to say about acupuncture is David Gorski. He additionally writes for the website Science Blogs. His blog is entitled, “Respectful Insolence”. In this context he uses the pseudonym “orac”. He also concludes that acupuncture is mere “theatrical placebo”. In his post “An acupuncture bait and switch on hypertension”, Gorski points out that when you encounter a study that claims to support the efficacy of acupuncture, you should probe a little deeper. Then you will likely find one of the following problems with the study: Inadequate or no blinding; small sample size; improper or inadequate controls; statistical problems; subjective instead of objectives outcomes; and the use of electroacupuncture. He points out that some of the positive studies in support of acupuncture for treatments such as hypertension, are actually using elecroacupuncture, which he argues, is no longer acupuncture. It is adding a scientific treatment, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), to acupuncture and using that as justification for acupuncture. 
Gorski repeatedly argues that it is often the case that interesting findings within acupuncture studies do not in fact support acupuncture itself, but instead point to things that could be further explored and used within science-based medicine. In another “Respectful Insolence” entry entitled, “When what an acupuncture study shows is much more interesting than what acupuncture believers think it shows”, Gorski reviews a study (The Nedergaard study) which claimed to support the use of acupuncture. The study looked at the effect of using acupuncture in rats specifically in their peripheral nervous systems. Gorski wrote that the study did show that 1) sticking needles in mice and moving them around triggered release of the chemical adenosine and 2) adenosine decreases the pain response. Gorski points out that this is interesting and the use of adenosine as a potential treatment for pain should be further explored. However, one of the problems Gorski points out with the study conclusion that their findings support acupuncture is that mice are much smaller than humans. While the point used in the study is only millimeters away from the sciatic nerve in mice, it is centimeters away in humans. Also, in mice it is going to be easier to reach the nerves and those nerves will be much closer to the problematic tissue damage than in humans. He also points out that considerable amounts of research have shown that it does not matter where you place the needles or whether they are actually inserted. This indicates that it is not acupuncture as defined by acupuncturists that is making the difference in humans and thus it should be left by the wayside. 
In his “Respectful Insolence” post, “Psychological correlates of the placebo that is acupuncture”, Gorski expresses concern over some acupuncture proponents embracing that its benefits are largely placebo related, as justification for its use. He points to a pro-acupuncture article entitled “Psychological Covariates of longitudinal changes in back-related disability in patients undergoing acupuncture” (Lewith et al). The authors assert that because there is a significant advantage to receiving acupuncture over wait list controls, however not a major difference between acupuncture and sham acupuncture, then it is primarily nonspecific (placebo) effects that are responsible for the improvements observed with acupuncture. Then the authors assert that this is good justification for the use of acupuncture. By contrast, Gorski argues that the purely placebo benefits of acupuncture do not make a case for its use. Instead, the aspects of acupuncture that produce placebo benefits, such as an empathetic healer, should merely be fostered as an adjunct to science-based treatments. In other words, he is saying that it would be better for low-back pain patients to go to a medical doctor who is also empathetic and then they can also receive treatments “shown to work”. 
However, in my experience, the primary treatments for conditions such as pain in a physician’s arsenal are medications and surgery. These are not treatments that come without risk. Pain medications have side effects and a high risk of dependency. Surgery always has risks. Whereas, acupuncture has been shown to be very low risk if conducted by Western trained acupuncturists who for example, know to avoid the lungs and use clean needles (Ernst). So, acupuncture seems safer to me than say, narcotics. Additionally, as Gorski says himself, the more theatrical a placebo treatment, the greater the patient response. This is why surgery has stronger placebo benefits than sugar pills. Acupuncture has been noted to be one of the most theatrical of placebos. So with acupuncture for something basically innocuous, like low-back pain, there is less risk than a patient would have going to a medical doctor and additionally, the placebo benefits might be greater. So, that to me seems like a good justification for acupuncture. Of course, considering whether prescribing a treatment purely for placebo effects is a whole other can of worms that I will address later.
Another example of a pro-acupuncture writer is science journalist Donna Nakazawa. In her book, “The Best Last Cure”, she describes acupuncture as one of the alternative treatments that helped her finally experience relief after years of suffering with chronic illness. She found, as I have, that the research data on acupuncture is controversial. Specifically, she points to the issue that findings in support of traditional acupuncture have been reproduced using sham acupuncture. This has raised the issue that possibly acupuncture is no more than placebo. 
However, Nakazawa points to studies which indicate that the positive effects of both real and sham acupuncture trials may be due to sham acupuncture having real effects that are attributed to its similarity to acupressure. She points to a study by Harris et al (2009) published in “Neuroimage” which with the use of positron emission tomography (PET scans) with fibromyalgia patients which concluded that the brain responds differently to traditional acupuncture and sham acupuncture. Nagazawa writes that the study shows that when traditional acupuncture is conducted on participants, the areas that light up indicate that the opioid systems and endorphins are activated while amygdala activity is attenuated. This does not occur with sham acupuncture. When sham acupuncture is conducted, areas of the brain associated with temporary pain relief are stimulated. Nagazawa states that this may be because sham acupuncture may in fact be replicating the pressure points utilized in acupressure, which she states is a well-proven treatment for certain conditions, such as nausea. Thus, both traditional and sham acupuncture are in fact doing something real beyond mere placebo. 
This point confuses me because it is my understanding that numerous studies have shown a slightly different point about sham acupuncture. Sham acupuncture trials have shown that it both does not matter if the skin is penetrated by needles nor where the needles are placed. Thus there is no possible meaning to the acupuncture claim of Qi, or meridians. Acupressure supposedly works by also accessing these traditional points (Robinson et al 2011). If the points do not matter, wouldn’t this bring acupressure into question also? 
The citation Nagazawa uses for her claim that acupressure is well-proven is a systematic review published in BMC Complementary Alternative Medicine (Robinson et al 2011). The findings of the review of 71 acupressure studies were that acupressure “may be beneficial for pain, nausea and vomiting and sleep”. The numerous other conditions reviewed were found to have only “variable/poor quality evidence”. The journal name raised my brows as I wondered if it had an agenda to support alternative medicine claims which make it biased. The journal claims to be “neutral” and rigorously scientific; however, the aforementioned skeptic, David Gorski, has written a Respectful Insolence post questioning this.  
The different brain regions responding to traditional versus sham procedures is intriguing; however it makes me think of concerns raised by Ben Goldacre regarding reading clinically significant findings into studies measuring mere secondary outcomes. Brain scan changes would be a secondary outcome. That is, they are measuring the effect that acupuncture has on brain scans. They are not directly measuring the effect that acupuncture has on a primary outcome. A primary outcome is what really matters, such as symptom attenuation. Just because certain areas of the brain light up does not mean necessarily that acupuncture eases, for example, patient’s pain levels. 
Also, could the brain changes be what we would see on a scan if a person was having a placebo reaction? A study in the Journal of Neuroscience suggests this is true. The researchers found that administration of a placebo led to “endogenous opioid activity on mu-opioid receptors” and a corresponding reduction in reports of pain intensity (Zubieta et al 2005). Thus, these findings leave me wondering if the brain scans that Nagazawa uses to support her statement that sham acupuncture is a treatment beyond placebo, in fact is simply showing us how placebo effects look in the brain. When I read the Harris et al study Nagazawa referenced, the authors themselves describe the changes observed in the brain during the sham acupuncture as small and showed “an effect more consistent with previous placebo PET studies”. Also, interestingly, the perceived improvement in pain by patients was the same in both groups, which seems to speak to my concern about whether the differences observed on the PET scans were clinically meaningful or saying anything important about primary outcomes. Also of note, the study included only 20 subjects and it did not include a no-treatment control group. 
I decided to further explore the citations she uses in support of acupuncture. While one was positive, another was negative regarding acupuncture. On the pro-acupuncture side, a study published in the journal Human Brain Mapping conducted at Massachusetts General Hospital used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to evaluate acupuncture effects on 13 normal subjects. The authors found that needle manipulation decreased activity in the limbic system and subcortical structures of the brain whereas sham acupuncture did not (Hui et al 2000). Whereas, in a systematic review of 57 systematic reviews of acupuncture for pain, including 4 considered to be of excellent quality, Ernst et al (2011) concluded that there is “little truly convincing evidence that acupuncture is effective in reducing pain” and that there are serious adverse effects.    
The reference list of one of her cited articles led me to some other interesting articles that all found no difference between traditional and sham acupuncture. The first was a systematic review published in the journal Chinese Medicine (Zhang & Bian 2010) which looked at 12 acupuncture trials comparing traditional and sham acupuncture. Six of the twelve had low risk of bias. Of those six, five studies showed no difference between traditional and sham acupuncture.  Secondly, a 2009 systematic review published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine concluded that their findings “cast doubt” on whether there is a difference between traditional and sham acupuncture. Finally, a 2015 study published in Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine looked found no difference in reports of pain whether subjects received acupuncture needles pressed on the skin, needles not touching the skin, or received no treatment at all (Takayama et al).
Then I decided to look at what Cochrane has to say. I found 40 systematic reviews of studies on acupuncture and various conditions. I looked at the first 15 conditions that came up. 10 out of the 15 concluded there was insufficient evidence available to draw conclusions that acupuncture helped with the condition. These included: shoulder pain, depression, epilepsy, stroke, vascular dementia, asthma, uterine fibroids, insomnia, Bell’s Palsy, and period pain. The exceptions were fibromyalgia, neck pain, migraine, osteoarthritis, and schizophrenia. Of these, the benefits of acupuncture on fibromyalgia, migraine, and osteoarthritis were no better than sham acupuncture. Regarding schizophrenia they concluded there was “limited evidence” of the benefits of acupuncture. The only condition I found that showed moderate evidence in support of acupuncture and that was better than sham acupuncture was neck pain.
Since I suffer from migraines, I dug a little deeper. Regarding the findings that acupuncture and sham acupuncture helped those with migraines, Cochrane proposed some explanations: 1) It may be that acupuncture is a particularly potent placebo. The elaborate procedure involved may be more effective at triggering placebo than taking a pill. 2) The physiological mechanisms manipulated by acupuncture might not be specific to particular points as traditionally assumed.  3) While the sham versus true acupuncture trials were blinded, the acupuncture versus prophylaxis drugs were not. Thus, the positive benefits of acupuncture could be explained by the expectations or beliefs of the researchers and/or subjects. 

Where does this leave me? Confused, yet also unimpressed with the science supporting acupuncture as an intervention beyond placebo. However, I am unsure how to explain the difference in brain PET and MRI scans between those receiving traditional and sham acupuncture. However, in the end, if the same positive results on pain, in particular, are found regardless of whether the skin is penetrated or not or where the needles are placed, is this supporting touch as being therapeutic? Might the benefits seen in acupuncture and sham acupuncture be similar to what is accomplished by massage therapy which does not claim to be guided by meridians? I did some perusing of the massage therapy literature and found that it appears to have more support than acupuncture. A 2004 meta-analysis of massage therapy done by Moyer et al revealed significant improvements in pain, anxiety and depression. A 2003 systematic review of both acupuncture and massage therapy conducted by Cherkin et al found significant benefits for back pain following massage therapy, whereas the acupuncture trials reviewed of too poor quality to draw conclusions. The authors concluded that a course of massage therapy decreases overall patient costs in treating back pain; whereas the same cannot be said of acupuncture. A 2001 randomized trial of 262 patients with low back pain compared traditional acupuncture to massage therapy. Conclusions were that massage therapy was effective and provided long lasting benefits whereas acupuncture was found to be ineffective (Cherkin et al).  Singh and Ernst state that massage therapy is helpful for “some musculoskelatal problems, especially, back pain, for anxiety and depression, and for constipations. It acts, possibly, by increasing local blood flow and releasing endorphins in the brain”.  The Moyer et al study also indicated that it may be the psychological benefits of massage that account for much of the improvements associated with it. This then brings us back to issues related to the benefits of placebos. My final conclusion about acupuncture is that it is not worth my time and money. However, massage is both shown to be scientifically validated for pain and in my experience, immensely pleasurable. Thus I have no difficulty justifying spending money on it. 
Conclusion:
None of the alternative treatments I reviewed, with the exception of massage and a non-extreme healthy diet, seemed to have scientific backing to justify their use beyond placebo. In the next chapter I will look at another type of alternative treatment that warranted its own chapter, that is the area of mind-body medicine. After that we will follow up with the issue that has emerged about the use of alternative treatments for their placebo value.  

Chapter Four Mind-body medicine
As discussed in chapter three, some people in my life have asserted a psychological explanation for my illness. Several have stated they think my illness was caused by job stress. One person even posited that my illness (even though diagnosed as medical by two neurologists) was caused by depression associated with not having a baby. Let me just say, that I chose to be childfree, so that argument was particularly bizarre and out of left field.  Assuming a psychological cause for chronic illness, particularly if its symptoms are invisible to others, seems to be quite widespread. This was jarring at first, because I did not see it that way and did not expect others to view me that way. 
I have also gotten the impression that others are uncomfortable with my acceptance based way of coping with my illness. When I first became ill and read books on coping with chronic illness written mostly by others who have dealt with it themselves, I found they all emphasized the limitations and even damaging effects of trying to control or fix your illness. They instead emphasized the importance of acceptance. Because I had already been so impressed with mindfulness and acceptance practices with in my work as a psychologist treating mental health issues, I quickly got on board with the usefulness of such an approach in working with my chronic illness. When dealing with uncertainty regarding diagnosis, grappling with a jiggly world, and debilitating exhaustion, I found that learning to let things be and drop the rope gave me the most relief. If I did not judge my experience and opened to it as it was, I felt much more capable of being with it. A tremendous sense of peace followed. 
However, this attitude of acceptance I developed seemed to rub others in my life the wrong way. When I discussed how “Okay” I was feeling about my predicament, I often encountered strange looks or silence on the other side. For example, when I discussed how much the book “How to Be Sick” had helped me, a family member said, “What a depressing title”. 
There is an area within alternative medicine that seems to particularly feed ideas such as that physical illness, especially that which is invisible to others, has a strong psychological component and that psychological approaches can cure you. That is the area of mind-body medicine. For some of the more extreme proponents of mind-body medicine, its message is that the cure for many ailments (its most extreme proponents would say ALL ailments) lies within you and is in your control. It asserts that much of what causes physical sickness has to do with the mind and thus healing also comes from the mind. If you have the right attitude you can harness this healing. The emphasis is on control, not acceptance. 
So, before we explore the writings of those who claim you can heal yourself with your mind, let’s take a look at the claim that a large amount of illness can be explained as being caused by the mind or that illness has a psychological component. Since some have suggested to me that it was stress from my job that made me sick, I began exploring the question of to what degree stress can cause physical illness. As a psychologist who has worked with Veterans with PTSD I knew that extreme stress could aggravate some forms of illness. PTSD is associated with higher rates of pain, high blood pressure, and can even shrink the hippocampus, part of the brain that enables us to store new information. But the day to day stress I had, which I considered to be within the range of normal for most professional people, was very different than what those suffering from PTSD experience. Additionally, I was not sure whether stress was necessarily related to my particular set of symptoms. 
In his book “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers” researcher Robert M. Sapolsky presents evidence that chronic stress, including psychological stress, can make us sick. He states specifically that “chronic or repeated stressors can potentially make you sick or can increase your risk of being sick”.  He elaborates by adding that stress actually makes you more vulnerable to diseases that make you sick. Stress can “wreak havoc with your metabolism, raise your blood pressure, burst your white blood cells,” etc. Many factors determine whether this occurs, one of which is personality. Sapolsky describes in great detail what happens in our bodies when the stress response is turned on. If this detail interests you, his book is very informative. 
The stress response, also known as the fight-or-flight response, involves mobilizing energy for immediate action needed for self-protection such as fleeing or fighting and numbing pain perception in case of attack. It also inhibits non-urgent activities such as digestion and immunity. When stress is chronic our bodies become exhausted and we become vulnerable to stress related diseases. This is because there are consequences to the stress response that build when it is repeatedly turned on. For example, energy is depleted, blood pressure is chronically raised, and the long-term projects of the body become permanently on hold. Growth and reproduction can be halted. The body’s natural repair processes can be halted. Brain cells can be damaged by the hormones secreted during the stress response.  And of course because immunity is hindered you become more vulnerable to infectious diseases.  
He describes how the same physiological processes are triggered within the body regardless of whether the threat is real or imagined. So, our body becomes alarmed in a similar way whether we are experiencing real, imminent danger such as being physically attacked or whether we are experiencing mere thoughts about something that may or may not be real and does not pose any serious physical threat, such as being concerned about whether others are gossiping about you.
Sapolsky addresses the role stress can play in making us more vulnerable to particular diseases. He describes the physiology of how this occurs in great detail if you are interested. Over time it can increase your risk for developing cardiovascular disease. When I have led anger management groups with Veterans with PTSD, we talk about how when they get angry their fight or flight response is in gear. Because of their training, they are conditioned to fight not flee. Group members discuss how anger episodes affects their bodies. They are encouraged to do this because developing awareness of the sensations produced by the stress response associated with anger can help them learn to better control their behavioral responses to it. Anger raises their blood pressure and makes them feel hot and tense. Their ability to think rationally is hindered as blood leaves their brain and rushes to body parts needed for action. They are often told by others that they turn red. Afterwards they are left with both physical and often emotional consequences (if they act on their anger inappropriately). Physically they are left feeling exhausted. Emotionally, they are left feeling regret and shame. The physical consequences seem to take a toll as many of them develop hypertension and heart conditions. Of course acting on their anger takes a toll on their relationships. They develop these responses out of necessity and it serves them well in a combat zone. However, when they return to civilian life, the same fight-or-flight response often becomes triggered by minor slights that pose no real threat to them. Unlearning what helped keep them alive is very difficult. Those of us without PTSD can also have our stress response triggered unnecessarily.  For example, our bodies turn on the fight-or-flight response when we panic about something that may or may not happen next week. Even though there is nothing we can do about it and our bodies being mobilized into fight-or-flight is useless.  
The metabolic activity triggered by the stress-response can cause other problems. Some individuals have an underactive stress-response and this can lead to difficulty mustering the energy for basic daily activities. An extreme case of this is called Addison’s disease. A milder form of it is involved in Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. These individuals do not have adequate levels of glucocorticoids needed to muster the energy to be active. For people in general, turning on the stress response too often over time can cause metabolic deficiencies. In Sapolsky’s words, “In effect, you are penalized if you activate the stress-response too often: you wind up expending so much energy that, as a first consequence, you tire more readily-just plain old everyday fatigue”. Then your muscles can atrophy. 
Also, when stressed, the ratio of good cholesterol (HDL) to bad cholesterol (LDL) is altered unfavorably. This can also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. Another problem is that stress raises insulin resistance. Chronic stress can make one more vulnerable to developing juvenile diabetes, worsen it once you have it. It can also make you more vulnerable to developing adult-onset diabetes. 
Stress can also affect the immune system; however the link between stress-induced immunosuppression and it increasing the risk of or causing diseases is “relatively weak and its importance often exaggerated”. Sapolsky describes how complicated it is to establish this link; however it is too involved for me to get into. However, in the case of diseases that relate to overactive immune function, the autoimmune diseases, the link is more clear. In the short-term, stress can actually turn on the immune system. However, when it is chronically activated such as by chronic stress, it can “begin to mistake part of you for being something invasive, and you’ve got yourself an autoimmune disease”. Stress can also worsen autoimmune diseases. Sapolsky stated that “Stress is among the most reliable, if not the most reliable, factor to worsen such diseases.
However, Sapolsky points out that not all diseases are caused by stress and that the relationship between psychology and health is often overstated and this can be damaging. Sapolsky describes how fibromyalgia was previously assumed by physicians to be psychological in nature simply because there was yet no clear biological explanation. Further research has now shown it to be biologically based. Sufferers “have abnormally high levels of activity in parts of the brain that mediate the emotional/contextual assessments of pain”. Also, “their cerebral spinal fluid contains elevated levels of a neurotransmitter that mediates pain” and “glucocorticoid levels are below normal”.  Since Sapolsky wrote this further evidence has come to light which shows that fibromyalgia sufferers have overactive nerve endings (citation). Unfortunately, fibromyalgia patients had to endure the experience of being treated as if they were imagining their pain. 
In the case of cancer, there is no support for a link to stress. However, Bernie Siegel, a surgeon at Yale University, claims that “cancer is curable if the patient has sufficient courage, love, and spirit”. Sapolsky counters by saying that this is not how cancer works and that this kind of thinking can be highly destructive for patients. Of the two published studies of Siegal’s cancer program, both reported no significant effect on survival rates. Sapolsky is disturbed by the widespread acceptance of Siegal’s type of thinking as evidenced by a 2001 study which indicated the most common cause patient’s attributed to why they developed breast cancer was stress. He states, “Everything bad in human health now is not caused by stress, nor is it in our power to cure ourselves of all our worst medical nightmares merely by reducing stress and thinking healthy thoughts full of courage and spirit and love”. He also states, “And shame on those who would profit from selling this view”.
Stress is a part of life for all of us and for those of us who experience chronic stress, it seems that there is a clear relationship established between stress and some diseases. As Sapolsky has pointed out it does play a significant role in the development of autoimmune diseases, which is what the Mayo Clinic thinks is behind my symptoms. However, I am not convinced it was work stress that caused me to get sick. My work stress was fairly minimal for years prior to becoming sick. As I have explained, my body was under extreme stress while trying to get off Paxil immediately prior to becoming ill. This was due to a severe Serotonin Withdrawal Syndrome. Then on top of that I got a bad flu. Thus, I can imagine how the physical stress my body experienced from these factors led my body to become confused and thus begin attacking itself. I just don’t see a strong argument for this stress being psychological in nature. I can see, however, that continuing to work while sick was extremely stressful and that that stress likely exacerbated and prolonged my illness. Although still ever present, my symptoms quieted down some eventually after I retired. They flare up when I am under stress or overly active. 
Now onto the idea that much of physical illness has a psychological cure. I was encouraged to read the book, “The Relaxation Revolution” by Herbert Benson. As I read it, I found myself feeling uncomfortable and even defensive. He makes what sounded to me like extravagant claims about the potential for self-healing. He makes such strong statements as “We now have scientific proof that the mind can heal the body”. And that “you have the innate ability to self-heal diseases”. He also states that “mind body science has now reached a stage where it should be accepted as the third major treatment and prevention options, standing as an equal alongside drugs and surgery in the clinical medical pantheon”. He states his treatment recommendations are based “not on speculation or wishful thinking but on scientific fact”. 
I think it would be easy for a sick person who is reading this to interpret it as meaning that whatever disease they may have, Benson is guaranteeing they can cure themselves with their mind. This may be an over interpretation of what he means. When he uses the word “heal”, I don’t think he means “cure”, so much as improvement. However, I can see how it may lead to false hope for some readers.
The conditions he claims to treat based on “fact” include “chest pains caused by heart disease, skipped heartbeats and palpitations, infertility, insomnia, menopausal, perimenopausal, and breast cancer hot flashes, premenstrual syndrome, Parkinson’s disease, premature aging, nausea, high blood pressure, many types of chronic pain, various phobias, arthritis symptoms, depression, and anxiety”. Well, this list is not very impressive to me. Four of the conditions he mentioned are psychiatric diagnoses, so of course mind-body treatments will help. Many of the others have to do with pain which is particularly exacerbated by psychological factors. Others are those known to be affected by stress. It just seems like a very limited set of conditions he is using to support his claim that “We now have scientific proof that the mind can heal the body”. 
From what I could tell, the studies he cites to back his claim regarding scientific “proof” are single studies. The studies used to support heart related conditions that I reviewed had sample sizes of only 7, 11, and 14 subjects. So, I went to Cochrane.org to see whether there are systematic reviews to support his claims. The two mind-body strategies he uses are relaxation and visualization. I found nothing about visualization on Cochrane. My search under the term relaxation found the following. 
Benson states that his relaxation based mind-body strategies work for heart related issues such as chest pains caused by heart disease, skipped heartbeats, palpitations, and high blood pressure. What I found on the Cochrane site was a 12/2014 systematic review on cardiovascular disease and transcendental meditation by Hartley et al which concluded, “Currently, there are few trials with limited outcomes examining the effectiveness of TM for the primary prevention of CVD. Due to the limited evidence to date, we could draw no conclusions as to the effectiveness of TM for the primary prevention of CVD. There was considerable heterogeneity between trials and the included studies were small, short term and at overall serious risk of bias. More and larger long-term, high-quality trials are needed.” Benson’s claim does not refer to prevention of cardiovascular disease. But I thought this review highlights the limitations of what has been shown regarding mind-body strategies for heart related issues. So, relaxation may help with the uncomfortable symptoms of heart disease, there does not seem to be clear evidence it can be used to prevent the disease. 
Regarding relaxation for high blood pressure, Cochrane had a 1/2009 systematic review by Dickinson et al which concluded, “In view of the poor quality of included trials and unexplained variation between trials, the evidence in favor of causal association between relaxation and blood pressure reduction is weak. Some of the apparent benefit of relaxation was probably due to aspects of treatment unrelated to relaxation.”
Regarding relaxation for menopausal and perimenopausal symptoms, Cochrane provides a 2014 review by Saensak et al which concludes, “Evidence is insufficient to show the effectiveness of relaxation techniques as treatment for menopausal vasomotor symptoms”.
He goes on to say that any condition caused or exacerbated by stress can benefit from mind body practices. However, when I looked up relaxation on Cochane’s website, I found systematic reviews on some conditions thought to be exacerbated by stress including IBS and asthma. 
Regarding Irritable Bowel Disease a 2011 review by Timmer et al concluded, “There is no evidence for efficacy of psychological therapy in adult patients with IBD in general. In adolescents, psychological interventions may be beneficial, but the evidence is limited. Further evidence is needed to assess the efficacy of these therapies in subgroups identified as being in need of psychological interventions, and to identify what type of therapy may be most useful.” Relaxation therapy was one of the psychological interventions included in the review. 
Regarding Irritable Bowel Syndrome a 2009 review by Zijdenbos et al: “Psychological interventions may be slightly superior to usual care or waiting list control conditions at the end of treatment although the clinical significance of this is debatable. Except for a single study, these therapies are not superior to placebo and the sustainability of their effect is questionable. The meta-analysis was significantly limited by issues of validity, heterogeneity, small sample size and outcome definition. Future research should adhere to current recommendations for IBS treatment trials and should focus on the long-term effects of treatment.” Again, relaxation therapy was one of the psychological interventions included in the review. 
Regarding Asthma, a 2006 review by Yorke et al concluded that: “This review was unable to draw firm conclusions for the role of psychological interventions in asthma due to the absence of an adequate evidence base. Larger, well-conducted and reported randomized trials are required in this area”. Again, relaxation therapy was one of the psychological interventions included in the review. 
Trick or treatment: Therapies designed to trigger the relaxation response have been found to have some limited success.  Relaxation has been found to be helpful in treating stress and anxiety and possibly effective in helping with insomnia, hypertension, and menopausal symptoms. It is uncertain whether it is helpful for pain. It does not appear to be effective for chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, dyspepsia and epilepsy.  They can aggravate problems associated with schizophrenia and severe depression.
Sapolsky: Meditation is beneficial for combatting stress if done regularly. It decreases glucopcorticoid levels and lowers blood pressure. Once again there is a “however”. Studies only show this to be true during meditation. It is unclear what happens afterwards. Sapolsky points out that most studies of meditation do not randomly assign subjects to treatment and control groups. Thus, there may be something different about those who choose to meditate that is not due to the act of meditating. 
Certainly, such conclusions do not support Benson’s statement and lead me to conclude that Benson exaggerates what can be said about the mind healing the body.
Benson goes on to say that since all health conditions have some stress component they can all benefit from mind body approaches. As I read this, I did not disagree that mind body practices can be beneficial in helping one cope with any illness. However I am unsure whether Benson is simply referring to improved coping or if he means mind-body strategies can directly treat all conditions to some extent. I think saying that mind-body strategies such as relaxation can improve all conditions would be an overstatement. For example, in the case of cancer a 2015 Cochrane review by Jassim et al of psychological interventions for women with non-metastatic breast cancer concluded, that cognitive behavioral therapy helped with some psychological outcomes associated with cancer, but the evidence that it improved survival is lacking. In a 2013 review by Mustafa et al on psychological interventions for women with metastatic breast cancer, the authors concluded that, “psychological interventions appear to be effective in improving survival at 12 months, but not at longer-term follow-up” and “findings of the review should be interpreted with caution as there is a relative lack of data in this field, and the included trials had reporting or methodological weaknesses and were heterogeneous in terms of interventions and outcome measures”. 
I think what Benson should say is more like, “We now have considerable evidence that the mind can ease symptoms of some conditions to some extent, particularly those with a strong psychological component, and help you cope better with any illness”.
One of Benson’s major arguments is that practicing relaxation can help to reverse the damage done to our bodies by stress. His other major argument is that we can heal ourselves if we believe we can. His two pronged approach to mind body healing includes using techniques that trigger the relaxation response and techniques that harness the power of placebo through positive beliefs and expectations. The latter raises a host of issues that will be addressed in the next chapter. 
The relaxation response is not a new concept for me. I was trained to use relaxation techniques for people with chronic pain and other illnesses. I have no problem with the idea that regular relaxation is good for your body and can help ease the discomfort of some symptoms. However, I am not certain about the extent to which it brings about long-term healing effects in a wide array of illnesses as Benson asserts. 
Also, Benson does not address that the use of relaxation techniques that have the goal of symptom reduction as a treatment for conditions such as anxiety and pain is highly controversial within the field of psychology. Those within the acceptance based movement have demonstrated through research that there is evidence that acceptance of difficult feelings such as anxiety and pain are more helpful than trying to alter it through such practices as relaxation exercises. (Eifert and Heffner2003; McCracken 2007; Keogh 2005; Levitt 2004). Acceptance-based practices such as mindfulness can help bring about a state of relaxation; however making relaxation the goal is considered to be contributing to the problem. This is because wrestling with or trying to change internal phenomenon often only serves to strengthen it.
Benson’s approach focuses on doing meditation to achieve the goal of relaxation. He makes emphatic statements to patients such as when working with a woman with chronic pain he described to her “the various research studies that have established beyond a shadow of a doubt that mind body approaches to treatment have a direct effect on beneficial physiologic and molecular changes in the body”. He explains that he emphasizes this in order to get her to believe in the treatment thus utilizing the power of the placebo effect. He also says it is “essential for you to break the train of your everyday thoughts”. He then guaranteed her that if she practiced relaxing regularly her periods of being free from pain would increase. The closest he comes to acknowledging the importance of acceptance is to say not to evaluate your performance while trying to relax. 
Benson also emphasizes avoidance of thinking about your symptoms and your illness. When practicing his visualization techniques which involve dwelling on memories of when you were “healthy, strong, and resilient” he says, “The more you focus on your specific medical problem, the less powerful your visualization will become. Even a fleeting memory of unpleasant symptoms, such as pain, may overstimulate pain centers in the brain and cause pain to intensify”.
By contrast, here are some statements from Jon Kabat-Zinn, also a practitioner of mind-body treatments, but one who works from an acceptance based approach when teaching meditation. 
“Almost everything we do we do for a purpose, to get something or somewhere. But in meditation this attitude can be a real obstacle…..Ultimately meditation is a non-doing. It has no goal other than for you to be yourself……For example, if you sit down to meditate and you think, “I am going to get relaxed, or get enlightened, or control my pain, or become a better person” then you have introduced an idea into your mind of where you should be, and along with it comes the notion that you are not okay right now.” Instead, “If you are tense, then just pay attention to the tension. If you are in pain, then be with the pain as best you can”.
He goes on to say, “People are either referred to the Stress Reduction clinic by their doctors or come on their own because something is the matter. The first time they come, we ask them to identify three goals that they want to work toward in the program. But then, often to their surprise, we encourage them not to try to make any progress towards their goals over the eight weeks. In particular, if one of their goals is to lower their blood pressure or to reduce their pain or anxiety, they are instructed not to try to lower their blood pressure nor to try to make their pain or anxiety go away, but simply to stay in the present and carefully follow the meditation instructions”. He says that “With patience and regular practice, movement towards your goals will take place by itself”.
Instead of emphasizing relaxation and symptom reduction, Kabat Zinn emphasizes acceptance as the key for healing,“By intentionally cultivating acceptance, you are creating the preconditions for healing”. Kabat-Zinn’s working definition of healing is “coming to terms with things as they are”. He states that, “In the course of our daily lives we often waste a lot of energy denying and resisting what is already fact. When we do that, we are basically trying to force situations to be the way we would like them to be, which only makes for more tension”. 
Thus, within Benson’s model, the goal is to control symptoms. Within acceptance based approaches, the goal is to change one’s relationship towards symptoms, which will often naturally lead to a reduction in symptoms. This is very different and I believe more pervasively powerful. The difference partly involves differences in opinion about what can be directly changed or controlled. Additionally, acceptance based models help one to learn a different way to relate to the inevitable day when all of us will encounter things we cannot control, such as death.  
Other psychological variables:
In addition pointing to how stress can make us sick, mind body proponents also claim that our attitude towards life effects illness. In the next part of this chapter, we will look at how psychological factors effect stress levels and illness.
Personality:
Sapolsky states that psychological factors modulate the size of the stress-response. He points to the research of two cardiologists, Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman, who found evidence that the Type-A personality (competitive, overachieving, time-pressured, impatient, and hostile individuals) was associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. However, it was later discovered that it specifically those with increased hostility that had the increased risk. It was also found that hostility is associated with a sense of time-pressuredness. For example, feeling frustrated that others don’t work quickly enough or that others slow you down in some way. Friedman and Rosenman also found that this time-pressuredness related to a sense of insecurity and that insecurity was an even better predictor of heart disease than was hostility. Sapolsky also stated that studies have shown that the “full expression of anger is a powerful stimulant of the cardiovascular system”. By learning to change their behavior, psychotherapy can help Type-A people change their cholesterol profiles, risk of heart attack, and risk of dying.
Sapolsky also describes health problems associated with what is called a repressive personality. This is people live highly structured lives, are concerned with conformity, dislike ambiguity, and look at things in black and white terms. They tend to avoid expressing negative affect. These individuals have been found to have a chronically overaroused stress-response. They have also been found to have a “relatively poor immune function”.
Personality factors that appear to buffer one against the diseases associated with aging were found by the Harvard psychiatrist George Valliant who studied a group of undergraduates throughout their life, beginning in 1941. Those who had the best health in later life had what is called a resilient coping style. This is defined as those with high extroversion, social connectiveness, and low neuroticism).
Control:
Sapolsky points out that perceiving one has a sense of control can help ameliorate the effects of stress. For example, letting pain patients control when they receive pain medication led to an overall decrease in how much pain medication they used. This was likely due to a decrease in the anxiety associated with uncertainty. Nursing home patients who were given control over when they would be visited by students during a study experienced improved functioning and health. 
However, this does not mean that simply recommending increased control is the answer. Those nursing home patients who were given control over when the received student visitors did worse after those visitations stopped than those who had no visitors and worse than they had been before the study.
As stated above, Sapolsky has said there is no evidence that stress causes cancer. However, there is some evidence that how one copes with the stress of having cancer impacts survival rates. Patients who respond to their cancer with a “fighting spirit” live longer than those who become depressed or go into denial. However, on the flip side, those who believe they have the power to cure their cancer by being positive are more likely to believe they failed or it is their fault if they end up dying from the disease.
Research on parents whose children were dying from cancer were studied by a groups of psychiatrists in the 1960s. They found a large variation in the levels of glucocorticoids (a stress hormone) that were secreted by the parents. They found that the parents who were able to 1) displace their worry onto something less significant 2) use denial of the possibility of relapse during times of remission 3) and use a religious rationalization to make meaning out of what was happening had lower levels of glucocorticoids. Displacement and denial are forms of illusory control. However, all the children in the study inevitably died. And those parents who used denial as a coping strategy had significantly higher levels of glucocorticoids than those parents who did not hide from reality when the time came that their children died.  
Sapolsky writes, “It is true that hope, no matter how irrational, can sustain us in the darkest of times. But nothing can break us more effectively than hope given and then taken away capriciously. Manipulating these psychological variables is a powerful but double-edged sword.” 
It seems to me that what Sapolsky is touching on here is that a coping strategy focused on control can be useful in areas where one actually has control. However, using such a strategy to cope with things for which one has little to no control can be temporarily comforting, but can be destructive in the long run when reality inevitably comes crashing through.   
I have witnessed the use of controlling what one can control as an effective coping strategy in one extreme case. When I was working as a social work case manager I had a client who managed to live home alone with advanced multiple sclerosis. She was completely paralyzed from the neck down. However her ability to think and communicate was intact. She was a very bright woman. She coped and was able to stay home by becoming extremely controlled about knowing exactly what she needed and communicating it effectively to her caregivers. She took this to an extreme. She was rigid in how she wanted every step of her care to be conducted and bossed her caregivers around. Her extreme rigidity and bossiness was obviously the way she coped with being entirely physically helpless. By doing this she was able to cope with the harsh reality of being in such a state. I marveled at her pluck. I recall she stated she appreciated my visits because I was cheerful and did not speak to her like an invalid. She stated when others encountered her they tended to become somber and tip toe around her. She found this depressing. So, keeping an upbeat attitude was another way she maintained a sense of control. However, since she did not cultivate other coping strategies such as acceptance and learning how to let go a little, how would she adjust if her mind and speech began to fail her as the disease progressed? 
Sapolsky discusses how too much control can be overwhelming. He points to the story of John Henry who tried to outrace a steam drill and it killed him. Sherman James of Duke University has coined the term “John Henryism” and describes it as “the belief that any and all demands can be vanquished, so long as you work hard enough”. As Sapolsky articulates if you are born into a setting where merit really matters, this can work well. However, for those born into poverty and racism this is not always helpful. In fact, Sapolsky states that this can cause an increased risk of hypertension and cardiovascular disease. 
As I described in the chapter “diagnosis hunting”, by trying to take control of my situation, I ended up spinning my tires and stressing myself out. The internet has greatly increased our capacity to seek out and gain slews of information. However, this information is not always helpful and can be overwhelming. Also, perceiving one has control can result in blaming oneself excessively for causing or not preventing one’s illness.
Also, Sapolsky highlights that perceived control is more helpful when dealing with small stressors and not so helpful when dealing with major ones. He also says it is important to consider the person and the situation when recommending control as a strategy. For example, it is not helpful to tell “a victim of some horror whose fault it is if they are unhappy”. Also, recommending having more control to someone living in poverty may not be helpful. An example I observed of the inappropriate emphasis on choice and control occurred while I was in college and working at a group home for seriously emotionally disturbed teen girls. I overheard a naïve fellow worker who was attending a local Christian college, lecturing the girls about the value of abstinence and maintaining one’s virginity until marriage. She came from a privileged and sheltered past and had no idea how to relate. Her audience was a group of girls who had all been sexually abused in some way during childhood. I assume she had not bothered to read their charts. Losing their virginity was not something over which they had any control. Further worsening the damage she was likely doing is the fact that many abuse victims tend to blame themselves for the abuse.
It helps to recognize you have control when in fact you do. However, it is important to recognize the circumstances in which your sense of control is illusory or when clinging to it makes things worse.
Positive thinking:
In the Relaxation Revolution, Herbert Benson states “If the patient is under emotional stress, believes that recovery is unlikely, or is otherwise in the grip of negative emotions, healing can be delayed or blocked. In contrast, if the patient enjoys a calm and positive mental state, natural recovery might take place more quickly”. I have wondered if some others in my life view my attitude of acceptance as blocking or delaying my healing. 
In her book, “Bright-Sided”, Barbara Ehrenreich challenges the idea that with a “positive mindset, your mind can influence your body”. She became interested in the topic after being diagnosed with breast cancer and suddenly finding herself entering into a world that emphasizes an upbeat attitude. She found this irritating and decided to explore where this emphasis on being positive when diagnosed with cancer came from. 
She describes positive thinking as being primarily an American obsession. She traces its origins to a reaction against the dour effects of Calvinism during the nineteenth century. A self-educated watchmaker, Phineas Parkhurt Quimby started writing about “the science of life and happiness”. When he and Mary Baker Eddy, the daughter of a fire-and-brimstone Calvinist father met in the 1860s, they “launched the cultural phenomenon we now recognize as positive thinking”. At the time they called it the “New Thought Movement”. In this new movement, God was no longer seen as harsh and humans were no longer sinful worms. God was described as ubiquitous, and “One Mind” and thus humanity was part of this “One Mind”.  
This led to thinking that today is called “The law of attraction”. Humans could access boundless power and control the physical world. Proponents of New Thought asserted that illness could be cured by the mind alone. While they found it did not work on conditions such as the infectious diseases, it did seem to work on the depression running rampant amongst women at the time likely due to their lack of opportunity to participate in the world in any meaningful way. 
Eddy then went on to found Christian Science. She taught that there is no material world, and thus no such thing as illness. The world is entirely under our conscious control. However, Ehrenreich points out that Christian Science held on to much of its Calvinist roots. While individuals were once judged for being sinful, they were now judged for showing signs of negativity. 
A fan of New Thought, Norman Vincent Peal popularized such thinking with his famous book The POWER OF positive Thinking. Ehreinrich goes on to discuss how positive thinking then swept through evangelical circles and also the business world. 
The field of psychology initially mocked such writers as Normal Vincent Peale. However, in 1997, when Martin Seligman became president of the American Psychological Association, he set in motion something that would get many in the field on board. He created what is called Positive Psychology, “the study of positive emotions and mind-sets like optimism, happiness, fulfillment, and flow”. The media loved advertising this “good news” and it seemed to give credibility to non-academics who preached positive thinking, such as motivational speakers, coaches and self-help gurus. They could now refer to “studies” to give them supposed credibility. Those in the positive psychology movement did not like being linked with this non-academic world and labeled it as fraudulent. Positive psychologists do not recognize the law of attraction as a real thing. They started out focusing on how to help people increase their happiness. Seligman and others then moved into the corporate world and taught companies how to increase their worker’s happiness to lead to an increased bottom line. Seligman stated that “Because good and services are plentiful and because simple needs are largely satisfied in modern societies, people today have the luxury of refocusing their attention on the good life”. 
Ehrenreich interviewed Martin Seligman in May 2007. Her description of this is quite amusing as she describes how unfriendly and blatantly avoidant Seligman was of directly engaging her questions. When she pointed out problems she had with his book, “Authentic Happiness” he tended to change the subject instead of giving direct answers or became snippy and condescending.
Ehrenreich points to comments made by critic of positive psychology, Barbara Held, professor at Bowdoin College. Held has stated that positive psychology encourages illusion at the cost of realism and objectivity because it may lead to more happiness. However, Held points out this is contradictory to the tenets of rigorous science, which positive psychology claims to be founded on. She calls this a “double epistemic standard”, simultaneously claiming to embrace unbiased science while recommending an “optimistic bias” towards life. 
Positive psychologists claim that besides being a desirable outcome in itself, happiness can lead to other good things such as health and success. There are many studies which link happiness and optimism to better health. However, as Ehrenreich points out most of these are only correlational and thus causation cannot be drawn from them. In other words, these studies leave open questions such as “Are people healthy because they’re happy or happy because they’re healthy?” 
To tease out what comes first, positive psychologist cite three longitudinal studies. The first one is the 2001 “nun study”.  Seligman has said that it is the “most remarkable study of happiness and longevity ever done”. It supposedly found that happy nuns live longer than less happy ones. This is measured by looking at the nun’s writings when they were about age 22 in 1930. They wrote about their commitment to being nuns. The researchers labeled the nuns happy whose writings included what they called “positive emotional content”. An example is “I look forward with eager joy to receiving the Holy Habit of Our Lady and to a life of union with Love Divine”. By contrast, those who wrote dryly “with God’s grace, I intent to do my best for our Order, for the spread of religion and for my personal sanctification”. As Ehrenreich points out, it is a big leap to go from the label “positive emotional content” to assuming those nuns were also happier. It could have merely been that these nuns were better at expressing themselves through writing. 
The second study emphasized by positive psychologists is one where the smiles of students in class photos in two mid-twentieth-century yearbooks for Mills College, a private liberal arts school for women, were analyzed. Those labeled smilers crinkled their eyes and turned their mouths up. These authentic smilers were found to be more happily married and satisfied with their lives decades later. Ehrenreich points out that the findings of this study were not replicated in a similar study done with high school yearbook photos from Wisconsin. In this study happy smiles did not predict happy lives”.       
And finally, positive psychologists point to a study done with Older Mexican Americans which found that those who were happy tended to live longer and be less frail. However, the study did not control for physical activity. Thus, Ehrenreich points out that the study participants could have been healthier because they were more physically active. She states that one of the authors of the study has acknowledged this to her. Despite all this, in Authentic Happiness, Seligman writes that this study combined with the other two paints “an unambiguous picture of happiness as a prolonger of life and improver of health”. 
Further muddying the waters is the fact that there are studies which show happiness may not effect one’s health. For example, an improved mental outlook does not lengthen the lives of patients with breast, throat and neck cancer. Optimism does not lengthen the lives of individuals with lung cancer. There is however some support for optimism protecting against heart disease which Seligman cites. However to contrast this, Barbara Held has found that 
* “people high in trait negative affect do more complaining about angina but are at no greater risk of pathology than cheerful people”.      
* “women who are mildly depressed are more likely to live longer than nondepressed or very depressed women”
* Preteens who were realistic about their popularity were less likely to become depressed than those who held positive illusions about their popularity. 
* A study conducted by Seligman found that “pessimists were less likely to fall into depression following a negative life event such as the death of a family member”.
However, as Ehrenreich points out the media tends to report only the studies with positive results. So, the general public gets a skewed idea about the relationship between happiness and health. One positive psychologist stated, “In the excitement that may be associated with this new and invigorating approach, it may be tempting to overextrapolate so as to convey a sense of the progress that is being made. This can be even more possible when a person from the news media is almost putting words in our mouths about the supposed discoveries and advances that already have occurred”.
Ehrenreich provides an example of how researchers in health and positive affect have acknowledged “serious conceptual and methodological reservations” when discussing their findings in an academic setting, then dropped such statements when asked to summarize their findings for “layman”. She points to one researcher and winner of the Templeton Foundation award for Positive Psychology did not mention her negative and mixed results when interviewed about her findings on the immune system and optimism, instead only discussing positive findings. This researcher told Ehrenreich in an interview that “To get the Templeton award….You don’t get anything for a null result” (null = no relationship or lack of positive findings). 
Ehrenreich points out how that the Templeton Foundation, a major funding source for research in positive psychology was created to support research that provides scientific credibility for religion. She also points out that the concept of “mind over matter”, which is consistent with the claims of positive psychology, grew out of American spiritualism in the nineteenth century. Additionally, Sir John Templeton himself was a proponent of Norman Vincent Peale and his popular and religious oriented book on positive thinking. Positive psychology was a field now offering scientific support for such ideas. 
The Templeton Foundation also does political work promoting the conservative agenda. Ehrenreich highlights that Seligman is also well known for being politically conservative and “impatient with victims and victimology”. Seligman has stated “In general when things go wrong we now have a culture which supports the belief that this was done to you by some larger force, as opposed to, you brought in on yourself by your character or your decisions”. While of course this suggests judgment towards for example, victims of poverty, racism, and sexual abuse; as a chronically ill person I wonder what Seligman would have to say regarding the cause of my situation. His comments suggest to me that he would think I am to blame. Interestingly, Seligman’s theory of depression includes the idea that depressed individuals tend to blame themselves for things going wrong in their life. Whereas, happier optimists tend to assume bad things that occur are not their fault. This seems to contradict his quote above about victomology being the problem.  
Ehrenreich writes that she attended the 2007 positive psychology summit and that although its atmosphere was similar to what she would expect at a motivational seminar, there were those who addressed concerns about the scientific foundations of positive psychology. For example, Ilona Boniwell, a professor of positive psychology in London stated that “healthy British skepticism” is one of the challenges faced in the classroom. When Ehrenreich spoke to her personally Boniwell stated, “A lot of results (in positive psychology), are presented as stronger than they are; for example, they’re correlational, not causative.” Also at the summit, Seligman himself stated that his theory of positive psychology is wrong because it is based on happiness which is “scientifically unwieldy”. He also stated that the field was under pressure to produce positive results because “people want happiness”.
Seligman has pointed out that pessimists and also depressed people tend to blame themselves for bad events that occur, see those events as pervasive, thus broadly and negatively affecting their lives, and also being permanent. Thus they tend to think, “It is all my fault, everything is ruined, and it will always be ruined”. I tried to honestly check myself and see if this applies to me. It does not. I do not blame myself for being ill, I try to limit its effect on my life by focusing on all the things I can still do in spite of being sick and I am neutral about whether I will always be sick. I tend to think I may or may not be. It is an unknowable. I think this makes me a realist. 
An optimist would likely think “I will get well!” and see my perspective as being overly negative. I think optimism requires a certain degree of self-delusion and that just isn’t my style. If it was I would still be attending church. The optimists that I know seem to view what I see as realism, as being a negative thing and falsely equate it with pessimism.
Environmental/lifestyle factors that affect health and stress levels:
The Harvard psychiatrist George Valliant also found that those undergraduates who had the best health in later life did not smoke, used little alcohol, exercised, were not overweight, and had warm, stable marriages.
Referring back to Sapolsky, when discussing that there is great variability in the physical decline of the elderly, he looked at various reasons why this might occur. He and Michael Meaney of McGill University found that the physical degeneration seen within again rats can be altered when researchers spend more time handling them in its first few weeks of life. Meaney later found that rat mothers who spend more time grooming their young in the first few weeks of their lives have the same positive effect. 
In baboons, those who spent a lot of time affiliating with other baboons through grooming and playing tended to have lower levels of glucocorticoids and did better as they aged than those baboons who had been more focused on domination in their prime.
Social support can be a buffer against stress. But not always. Sapolsky writes that while being in a good marriage is good for your health, being in a bad one is not. In women, this is associated with immune suppression. Infant monkeys who lost their mothers could be comforted if they were placed in a group of other monkeys; however only if those monkeys were not strangers. Also, being around other monkeys who are dominant can actually be stressful. So affiliation with others is only helpful if they are the right others. 
Sapolsky articulates what is widely known, exercise is great for your health. One of the ways it is good for you is that it helps counter the damage done by stress. It improves mood, decreases tension, and decreases your vulnerability to getting certain diseases. However, as we have seen before, there are caveats. Rat studies show that exercise is only beneficial if the rat wants to do it voluntarily. Also, it must be done regularly and not be overdone to be beneficial. 
There are many studies that purport to link good health with religiousity/spirituality. However, Sapolsky states that typically the methodology of these studies is questionable.  When a legitimate connection is found it is unclear which came first, the religion or the good health. It is also unclear to what extent it is merely the social support and avoidance of things such as alcohol and smoking that accounts for health benefits associated with religion. Experts in this field of research acknowledge that the evidence that religion improves health is limited.
Sapolsky writes that when we face a stressor we have to choose what coping strategy will work best. For example, sometimes we need to problem solve, other times simply express our feelings. Sometimes we need to figure out if there is something we can do to change things or if we must instead change our perception of it. I would say that one powerful way to deal with stressors we cannot change or control is to practice acceptance. Sapolsky states that in order to choose the best strategy, it requires that we have cognitive flexibility.  The psychotherapeutic approach called Acceptance and Commitment Therapy uses this idea as its key and overarching concept. The famous psychologist Martin Seligman recommends switching from an internal locus of control (it is up to you) to an external local of control (it is not your fault) when this is useful.   
Such environmental and lifestyle factors may contribute to health to some extent; however they have not prevented me from getting sick. I had a loving family while growing up. I have a wonderful and supportive marriage. Yet I am still sick. I walk my dog nearly every day. When I try to do more vigorous exercise, I seem to aggravate my symptoms. 
One book within the mind-body arena that I particularly enjoyed is “The Last Best Cure: My Quest to Awaken the Healing Parts of My Brain and Get Back My Body, My Joy, and My Life” by author Donna Jackson Nakazawa. She is a science writer and also has been living with Guillain-Barre syndrome and other chronic conditions. Her book explores the latest in mind-body healing research and also recounts her experience spending a year practicing meditation, yoga, and acupuncture to see what would happen. Her goal was to regain a sense of joy in her life, despite her circumstances. Much to her surprise after the year she experienced an unexpected radical improvement in her symptoms. These were both experienced subjectively and also measured by a physician. She did not experience a cure, but a drastic easing of her discomfort and limitations. I am thrilled for her and her experience of healing; however the researcher part of my brain wishes she had done each of the three practices separately and then had her physician measure changes in her test results. Otherwise it is impossible to know if all or some of the treatments were effective.   
I liked that although Nakazawa emphasizes the power of the mind to bring about healing, she does so with sensitivity. She acknowledges that some feel the message “you can heal yourself with your mind” sounds likes they are being blamed for their sickness and blamed if they do not get well. She points out that the sick should never be blamed for causing their own sickness or for failing if they do not recover. She acknowledges the variability between individuals and their unique situations. She states that for some, mind-body treatments might bring about a degree of actual physical healing, for others it may merely help with emotional healing and coping. All of which is to be celebrated. This is similar to my own thinking.
Her condition appears to have had a strong psychological component beginning with childhood trauma. She developed symptoms shortly after the tragic death of her beloved father when she was a child. Followed by no assistance by adults in coping and recovering from this loss. Since then she has lived her life in a perpetual state of stress which was eased greatly through mind-body techniques.
The book was in line with much of what I believe and have emphasized in this book, particularly about the benefits of meditation. I also have personal experience with the psychological healing effects of yoga. There is much research support for the psychological effectiveness of both modalities. Within the meditation section she draws on two of my favorite authors and thinkers, Jon Kabat-Zinn and Tara Brach. Both emphasize the power of mindfulness and acceptance-based approaches to bring about improved coping with symptoms. Additionally, particularly with conditions aggravated by mental factors such as stress, anxiety, and/or depression, practitioners can experience improvement of physical symptoms. She discusses two of my favorite books including Full Catastrophe Living by Kabat-Zinn and Radical Acceptance by Tara Brach. 
Conclusion:
Stress can make us sick. Doing what we can to minimize stress in our lives is clearly a good thing. However, stress cannot explain all illness. Nor are techniques to combat stress going to cure all. My job was stressful at times; however this does not mean that it caused my illness. It may have made me more vulnerable to whatever bad luck came along and made me sick, but I doubt it was the sole cause. Getting lots of rest, relaxation, and keeping my stress minimal seems to keep my symptoms at a minimum. However, I am still sick.
While having a sense of control over one’s illness and thinking positive are emphasized as good by some within the mind-body field, the research support for this is questionable and complicated. Regarding a sense of control, this can have a double edged sword. For me personally, I have found that it is best to try and distinguish honestly what I have control over and what I do not. There are many things over which I have control and it helps to remember this. For example, I can control whether I say no or yes to invitations for social engagements that may zap my energy. I can control little things about my environment that help boost my mood. I can live as healthy a lifestyle as is possible for me. However, there is much about my illness that is beyond my control and fighting against that only seems to make things worse. Ultimately, I have found that I can accept that there are things beyond my control and the more I do so, the more at peace I feel.  
This brings us to the topic of our next chapter, the placebo effect, or the power of belief about healing. This area is so huge it warranted its own chapter.
  Ellen Langer – mindfulness – given up on science over profit – science based medicine
In a Science-Based Medicine blog entry entitled, “Eminent Harvard psychologist, mother of positive psychology, New Age quack?”, writer James Coyne, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania medical school, criticizes mind-body researcher, Harvard psychologist, Ellen Langer. He reported that she has been called the mother of positive psychology and that her early research laid the foundation for the field. Langer gained fame in the research world in the 1970s with a study with nursing home patients. She found that those who were given a plant to care for cut their mortality by half compared to those who did not care for a plant. Coyne points out that this study’s methodology was poor and would not pass as respectable research today. Her positive findings were “likely spurious”. 
Coyne reported that she has a tendency to report the results of her studies to the media before they are replicated and regarding one study on a psychological treatment for diabetes, reported her results as being published when they in fact were not. In a study for which she has received much media attention, she claims to have found evidence for a psychological way to reverse aging. Coyne points out that the study has in fact never been subjected to peer-review and had only 9 men in the treatment group and 8 in the control group. 
She has plans to conduct a cancer study with 24 women with stage IV breast cancer where she hopes to shrink their tumors using psychological interventions. She will take them away from lives, put them in an environment that reminds them of their life before cancer, and surround them with distractions. She has stated the goal is to “purge any negative messages they have absorbed during their passage through in the medical system”.  At the time the Times published an article about the study, the IRB board at Harvard had not approved it; however the Times article implies otherwise. Coyne asserts that the study is unethical because there is no significant evidence to suggest that the study will benefit the subjects. 
Langer is now making plans to set up spa retreat locations where her aging reversal techniques will be used. She acknowledged she chose the locations because they made “an offer I couldn’t refuse” such as paying for her lodging and helping her set up research facilities in the area. When Coyne asked her whether such “nakedly commercial ventures will undermine her academic credibility”, Langer replied, “Look, I’m not 40 years old. I’ve paid my dues, and there’s nothing wrong with making this more widely available to people, since I deeply believe it.” 
Coyne stated that given all this, Langer is more like a New Age guru than a scientist.

Chapter Four Placebo
26% couldn’t find study, doe sit include part 2 of protocol?
He says ch 5 p. 72 is where evidence for belief is found.

The part of his writing that made me the most uncomfortable was his emphasis on belief as the key to healing. He claims if you believe you can heal yourself, you will. If you do not believe, you will then miss out on this miraculous healing. He uses research support for the placebo effect to support this. This certainly brought up memories of my religious background. I recall getting the message “just believe” and “just have faith” in church. Even though my initial reaction to Benson’s claims was skepticism, his writings also made me feel self-doubt. I wondered, “Is there something wrong with my attitude that is keeping me sick? Am I not relaxed enough? Is my skeptical nature keeping my sick?” This self-doubt was also familiar from my days growing up in church when I wondered what was wrong with me that I could not simply “believe” like everyone else. 
In particular it reminded me of a moment when as a college student, I attended a Benny Hinn meeting. Benny Hinn is a televangelist preacher who conducts large meetings where he works the crowd up and then performs “miracle” healings. I accompanied a friend to the meeting who was very enthusiastic about Benny. It was held in a large coliseum and had thousands in attendance. Benny wore all white and was illuminated by an impressive light display show. He jumped up and down, yelled, and tended to repeat statements over and over. He had everyone standing on their feet. People in the audience seemed to enter into a trance like state and some began “speaking in tongues”. He then yelled “I slay you in the spirit” or something close to that (it has been about 18 years). Then as far as I could see, all the people around me dramatically fell back into their chairs. I recall being the only person that I could see who was still standing. I felt confused and like I was definitely missing something everyone else seemed to feel. I wondered why don’t I? Believers might say that my heart was not open to the spirit or something that would put the blame on me. Skeptics might say something different. 
Anyway, some writers within the area of mind-body medicine remind me of Benny Hinn with their claims that “you too can be healed if you just believe”.
By contrast, Jon Kabat Zinn says that, “If you come as a true believer, certain that this is the right path for you, that mindfulness is the answer, the chances are you will soon become disappointed too. As soon as you find out that you are the same person you always were and that this work requires effort and consistency and not just a romantic belief in the value of meditation, relaxation, or mindfulness, you may find yourself with considerably less enthusiasm than before. In the Stress Reduction Clinic, we find that those people who come with a skeptical but open-minded attitude do the best. Their attitude is “I don’t know whether this will work or not, I have my doubts, but I am going to give it my best shot and see what happens”.
Just believe similae to religious folk say. This is enough for some who want to believe in the mystical.
(In Snake oil science-10%) medical ethicist Sissela Bok wrote “The Ethics of Giving Placebos” in Scientific american and concluded it was unethical.
Snake Oil Science – Inflated views about the power of the placebo relate to to falsely equating the improvements made in a placebo control goup with the placebo effect. He defines the placebo effect as “any genuine psychological or physiological response to an inert or irrelevant substance or procedure” and “a pharmacologically inactive substance that can have a therapeutic effect if administered to a patient who believes that he or she is receiving an effective treatment”.  Many factors besides the placebo effect can be responsible for improvements made by participants in a placebo control group such as, the natural course of the illness (natural ups and downs), that people behave differently simply because they are being watched, and a desire to please. The placebo effect alone can be detected by adding a group that receives no treatment and no placebo. He points to Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche’s systematic review. However, Baussel asserts that there are studies of high quality that do in fact provide support for a placebo effect; however these primarily exist within the area of pain. 
Bausell states that the placebo effect only occurs when the patient believes that the treatment he or she is receiving has the potential to work. He also states that it does not cure anything. “Alas, placebo effects are ultimately built upon human frailty, and they depend upon ignorance (or misconceptions) for their continued effectiveness”. 
In his book, Snake Oil Science, Bausell explores the question as to whether we have evidence that the placebo effect does exist. He cites both indirect and direct evidence. He states that the primary way the placebo effect is hypothesized to work is via classical conditioning. That is, it is a learned response that occurs after exposure to something that has real effects. Ivan Pavlov, who discovered classical conditioning, found that when dogs were given food by research assistants, they salivated. After enough times, they salivated simply by seeing the research assistants. Thus, an involuntary physiological response occurred even though there was no food. This applies to the placebo effect. For example, after having a positive experience with taking a pill or visiting a doctor, when one’s symptoms improve due to an active treatment, then later on the simple act of taking a pill of visiting the doctor alone, without being given any real treatment can trigger an improvement of symptoms. Bausell cites research which shows that humans have a physiological reaction to placebos they believe are a drug due to their past experience with taking that substance. However, the responses are also noted to not be as strong as the exposure to the real drug. Additionally, Bausell cites research on mice which established that the animals can be conditioned to experience immune system suppression when exposed to a placebo. While it cannot be assumed to work the same way for humans, it does indicate that placebo can effect various aspects of biology.
In addition to classical conditioning, Donald Price and Henry Fields (Bausell 38%) assert that three factors contribute to the placebo effect in the area of pain relief: classical conditioning; the desire or motivation to feel better; and the degree of expectation of improvement.  
Bausell asserts that because some placebos have a stronger effect than others, this provides direct evidence of the existence of placebos. For example, sham surgery is more powerful in triggering a placebo response than taking a sugar pill. However, he also notes that evidence in this area is generally based on small, single studies.  One exception to this was a large, high-quality study found that placebo acupuncture produced more pain reduction than a placebo pill. Additionally, there is evidence that the degree of motivation for improvement of symptoms effects the strength of the placebo response. 
Bausell stated that there is impressive evidence that in addition to pain, the placebo effect can impact depression and Parkinson’s disease. There is some evidence it impacts postoperative swelling, movement disorders, vital signs, blood pressure, weight loss, exercise tolerance, healing of ulcers, cholesterol reduction, blood sugar, headaches, drowsiness, respiration, and cortisol levels. However, further research is needed to firmly establish this. 
High-quality evidence of the existence of the placebo effect includes the following: A study in which patients suffering from minor illnesses such as colds who were given a “firm diagnosis and told confidently that they would be better in a few days” recovered faster than those who were told their diagnosis was uncertain. In a study with patients recovering from thoracic surgery, patients who were told their IV (only placebo) contained a powerful painkiller required 34% less analgesia than those who weren’t told anything.   
Another high-quality study reported on by Bausell was conducted by Price et al 1999. During the first part of the study, Price administered different levels of pain to participants via a thermal device. However, the participants did not know they were receiving different levels of pain. They were told that the different levels of pain were due to being given either water or a strong analgesic. However, they were all given only placebo. During the second part of the study, they were administered the same level of pain each time; however told they were receiving the analgesic or not. They reported decreased levels of pain when believing they were receiving the analgesic. This response was thus entirely based on expectations shaped by previous experience. Price was thus testing whether placebo via classical conditioning applied in humans. Bausell states that he can think of no other explanation for this other than the placebo effect.
Bausell asked the question, does the placebo effect exist only in the patient’s imagination or there a physiological mechanism involved? To answer this he pointed to studies which have shown that the drug naloxone, an opioid antagonist, could block the placebo effect (Amanzio et al). Positron emission tomography (PET) scans administered both following the administration of opioid analgesic drugs and placebos have revealed similar areas of the brain lighting up. They are those with a high concentration fo opioid receptors. Thus, it makes sense to consider that the placebo effect may involve a triggering of the body’s own opioid system. 
In his Respectful Insolence blog “Placebo vs the law of attraction”, Gorski writes that many within the alternative medicine field, such as Ted kaptchuk, are embracing the findings that their treatments are primarily placebos. To justify themselves they are promoting the placebo as “powerful” and greatly exaggerating what it can do in their marketing. Gorski compares the way they present it to the claims of the book the Secret. That is, they are presenting placebo as something magical, such as the idea that if you wish hard enough for something, such as healing, it will happen for you. He also says that research has shown that placebo does not ever bring about a cure and it does not effect objective outcomes. In other words, placebos don’t change physiology. They only change the subjective experience of patients. So patients say the feel better when the receive placebos because they have changed their perspective. They then tend to focus less on their symptoms, such as pain. 
Gorski states that the use of placebo alone as treatment is unethical because it requires deception. The use of it creates a paternalistic relationship between doctor and patient, where the patient is blindly placing their health in the hands of a physician who is treating them based on the assumption that it is in the patient’s best interest for them to not have all the facts. This is the opposite of informed consent which is something taken very seriously within science-based medicine today and is the reason prescribing placebos is no longer accepted in mainstream medicine. While this use of placebo is advocated for under the guise that it helps patients take control of their health, in fact the opposite is true. It means keeping patients in the dark. There are some who believe that deception is not necessary for placebo to work; however Gorski points to the key study in this area done by Ted Kaptchuk and says it does not support this claim.

He states that sometimes relaxation is enough for a patient to experience benefits. However, with more stubborn problems he tells patients they may additionally need to use his practice of harnessing “remembered wellness”.  He describes how he tells a pain patient, he says “For you to experience relief from your back pains you must incorporate these two factors into your mind body healing plan”. The second factor for her was to regularly practice remembering a “state of perfect wellness you experienced and enjoyed in the past”.  This concept of remembered wellness (citation 2). Benson claims that having a condition like pain over time self-perpetuates. He told the same pain patient that her “nerves, brain synapses, and even her genetic responses had been programmed to produce pain”. And that his techniques reverse this.  
 His claims about the placebo effect and his techniques for harnessing it to heal oneself opens a whole other can of worms. Benson states it is essential for patients to be convinced that mind body healing work for them to benefit from it. He basis this on the statement that “Many hundreds of scientific studies have shown that an inner conviction, which the medical community has linked to the phenomenon called “the placebo effect,” can help produce healing for scores of diseases and medical complaints. The placebo effect is a mind body mechanism that may bring about healing through a person’s expectation and belief that a certain treatment will work”. When I read this statement I felt uncomfortable because I know that Cochrane Collaboration systematic reviews have highlighted that the idea that benefits found in the placebo controlled arm of a research study have been misinterpreted to mean the definition of placebo as positive expectations and beliefs. When in fact the positive findings in the placebo group represent something broader, that is, anything that may have caused positive change besides the treatment being measured. So, this could also include the common improvement seen in conditions when time passes, the attention being paid by researchers, and other factors. Benson does not say which studies he is referring to and whether he has considered this when mentioning “hundreds of studies”. 
Chapter 1
2 Benson…the study he refers to regarding remembered wellness. Benson and Friedman “Harnesing the Power of the Placebo Effect and Renaming it “Remembered Wellness”. In this article, Benson argues for renaming the placebo effect because of the negative connotations it carries. He suggests calling it “remembered wellness”. He states that “The placebo effect is that aspect of treatment not attributable to specific pharmacologic or physiologic properties”. This broad concept would include that passage of time, the statistical concept of regression to the mean, demand characteristics, the positive attention of a researcher or physician, or other factors. The Cochrane Collaboration has pointed out that most studies that indicate a placebo benefit do not distinguish beyond this broad concept. However, without addressing this, Benson then appears to make the leap to saying there are three components necessary to generate the placebo effect, “(a) positive beliefs and expectations on the part of the patient; (b) positive beliefs and expectations on the part of the physician or health care professional; and (c) a good relationship between both parties (5).  His reference for this is his own work, “The placebo effect – a neglected asset in the care of patients”. 
He goes on to say that “the effectiveness of the placebo effect has been documented in a wide variety of diverse conditions that include angina pectoris, asthma, congestive heart failure, and mortality in coronary artery disease.” I checked his references for this statement. He references an article he wrote regarding angina pectoris. I was unable to access it through google scholar, the free research tool that I use. It might be a great study. In support of his asthma claim he cites Butler and Steptoe “Placebo response: an experimental study of asthmatic volunteers”. This study had only 12 participants (that is small). However, I found it fairly impressive. 
Regarding congestive heart failure he cites “Placebo treatment in congestive heart failure”. This study found that improved exercise endurance, but no change in objective lung function. 
I could not access the studies regarding coronary artery disease that he cites. 
Benson offers an impressive list of studies which found support for the validity of the placebo effect. He then says that to (29%) “Understand and accept with conviction the efficacy of the scientific research in the realm of belief and expectation” and then “Expect the scientific research to apply to you personally and to your particular disease or health complaint”. This statement bothers me because I am aware of the Cochrane Collaboration’s systematic review of the placebo effect which found that it does not have a significant effect with most of the conditions/diseases they reviewed. Even researchers who argue for the significance of the placebo effect do not claim that it is relevant for all diseases. As referenced above, Stewart-William’s criticism of the Cochrane review was in part that Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche lumped together conditions that likely are susceptible to placebo with those that ARE NOT. They go on to say that no placebo researcher would say that it works for all conditions. For example, Fuente-Fernandez et al (2001) point out that one key way the placebo works may be through expectation of reward triggering dopamine in the brain. As they demonstrated, this is effective in a condition such as Parkinson’s because the problem in Parkinson’s is insufficient levels of dopamine. 
However, Benson’s book clearly says something different. He says because placebo has been proven with many conditions, this list will likely grow, and that you, his reader should believe it applies to your condition. I then wonder, “Should I really?” Maybe Benson thinks that although it may not work with your condition, you have the best chance that it will if you believe. I have a problem with this. Could it not be harmful to me to set up my expectations that I will heal and then not do so? Could this not have the potential to be soul-crushing?
Another concern I have regarding Benson’s encouragement to assume his visualization technique will heal any condition is that placebo researchers have found that different types of placebo processes work for different conditions. For example, some conditions responded to verbal suggestion, or a process that triggers change via conscious expectations. Whereas some conditions do not respond to this and instead respond to unconscious conditioning, such as receiving a pill that works for that condition, then receiving a sugar pill instead. So, which of these types of placebo process is occurring with the visualization technique? Benson does not get into such details.
He goes on to say his steps and procedures are “proven” and that he recommends you use his two step protocol, including as I have described above, a relaxation component and a placebo component. He has renamed the placebo component, “remembered wellness”. He states he has done this in part because the term placebo had negative connotations, because traditionally the placebo effect used without the patient’s knowledge (which is unethical) and because he thinks memory plays a significant role. His definition of remembered wellness is that it is something that “occurs when the patient, in full knowledge of the need to believe or expect positive results, wills the belief and expectation to occur”.  The citation he includes in support of this is: Benson and Friedman, “Harnessing the Power of the placebo Effect,” 193-99. This citation does not provide enough information to find it. 
He goes on to state that remembered wellness is “rooted in the patient’s memories of good health”. He again references the above citation that provides inadequate information for you to find it. Here he also references: Benson, H., and M. D. Epstein, “The Placebo Effect: A Neglectd Asset in the Care of Patients,” Journal of the American Medical Association, June. 23, 1975, 232(12): 1225-27. I purchased this article for $30.00 hopeful it would offer empirical validation for the idea of remembered wellness, or the value of using his technique to visualize when you were in good health. Instead it cites other research about placebo and specific diseases without describing those studies. The bulk of the article is about the significance of the doctor-patient relationship to the placebo effect. It states that “Both the physician and the patient contribute to the placebo effect, but their actual interaction is probably most repsponsible for the effect. There can be no doubt that the placebo derives its power from the vast potential of the emotion relationship between the omnipotent physician and the needs of the patient.” This has nothing to do with the supposed power of memory of wellness to heal. Instead, it seems to actually contradict the idea that I can heal myself by visualizing what it was like when I was well as this is done in isolation without any interaction with a physician. The only statement that seems remotely applicable is “The act of removing the patient from the surroundings in which he has been ill can beneficially affect the illness”. There is then the following citation: Gliedman LH, Gantt WH, Teitelbaum HA: Some implications of conditional reflex studies for placebo research, Am J Psychiatry 113:1103-1107, 1954. 1954? That is some OLD research.     (go to MU)
While discussing how to use his visualization technique, Benson states “The more you focus on your specific medical problem, the less powerful your visualization will become. Even a fleeting memory of unpleasant symptoms, such as pain, may overstimulate pain centers in the brain and cause pain to intensify.” I did not find a citation for this claim; however it certainly might be true. What makes me uncomfortable is that his statements make me, “Oh shit, you better not think about your pain or it will get worse”. This makes me feel more anxious about it.  He seems to be subtly promoting an avoidance based approach to suffering. Sort of like, “If you don’t think about it and pretend you are not sick, you won’t be”. There is a downside here that Benson does not address. Wishing does not necessarily make it so, but it sure can highlight the discrepancy between how you feel and how you want to feel. In “You are not your pain”, Burch and .. say that focusing on this discrepancy only makes you feel worse. They also say that “whatever you resist persists”. They recommend an approach that involves exploring your discomfort non-judgmentally and that this is what eases it, not trying not to think about it. Benson is right in that ruminating on the problem does not help either, but his answer seems to involve denial and avoidance. Ruminating is not the same thing as noticing and acknowledging what is present. Ruminating involves all the mental chatter that we add to what is present such as “This isn’t fair” and “Why me” and “This is unbearable”.  The mindfulness based approach of Burch and …. Involves acknowledging what is there without adding anything to it, such as a harsh negative judgment.  I find this personally much more powerful and effective. 
 uncomfortable with it because it conflicts with the acceptance based approach that I have found so helpful. Within the acceptance based approach one is encouraged to openly explore one’s symptoms, even relaxing into them and that through engaging in this process they lose some of their power and intensity. Benson is advocating more of an avoidance approach which is inconsistent with the model of acceptance offered by Jon Kabat-Zinn and the third wave of behaviorism which is gained great success in the field of psychology.
He then goes on to discuss how his approach is consistent with a cognitive-behavioral therapy approach. He states, “But if you can somehow transform your thinking into a more positive mindset, your mind can influence your body and emotions in a happier, calmer, healthier direction.” As is illustrated by the rising success of the third-wave of behaviorism, Zen article in psychology today.  Benson does say toward the end of his chapter on visualization that “Many of the visualizations we suggest in the next chapter are based on this assumption: You can restructure your thinking processes to expect good health rather than bad. With that expectation, your mind will more likely influence your body in a healthful direction”. To highlight, he uses the word “assumption” here which suggests he is aware that the idea that we can change our thinking is a controversial and in no way proven idea within psychology.
Chapter 5: Benson begins his case for the power of the expectation or belief and his own concept of remembered wellness by citing a study by Mosley et al (2002) which looked at 165 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee. They were randomly assigned to one of three groups, either receiving arthroscopic debridement, arthroscopic lavage, or sham surgery (placebo). The researchers found no difference in reported pain or functioning between those who received the treatments versus the placebo. Benson used this study to support the power of expectation or belief. He states, “The sham surgery worked as well as the real surgery”. Technically, this is true, but his statement is misleading. He is implying that the placebo is powerful because it works as well as a successful medical intervention. However, what the study actually shows is that arthroscopic debridement and lavage are not effective treatments. It is entirely possible that the sham and active treatments were not different because none of them work. The only way to demonstrate that the placebo intervention or sham surgery was actually effective would be to have a fourth group, a no treatment control group. Otherwise you have no way to know what the placebo group was actually measuring. Was it measuring the psychological effects of believing you were receiving surgery or was it measuring simple regression to the mean or something else. If the placebo group was significantly improved over the no treatment group, then you say something about the power of placebo. Mosley et al acknowledge this, stating they could not distinguish between active effects of the placebo versus natural history of the condition. 
Benson states, “Just as an antibiotic drug may stop an infection or surgery may eliminate a malignancy, so the mind-your mind- has the capacity to treat or even cure man of your serious physical and emotional complaints”. Doesn’t this seem like a bit of an overstatement? It is seeming to suggest that the mind is just as powerful in healing physical problems in the body as something like an antibiotic treating infection. He then says that if you can’t say that you believe the statement, you might have an “overly narrow mindset”.

When I consider pursuing treatments purely for their placebo value I am reminded of the friends I know who are into tapping. Since they were interested in its psychological value, without criticizing them, I suggested they check out books on mindfulness training. This is because, while tapping may have some placebo benefit or even be stumbling upon some aspects of what is common amongst psychotherapy treatments, why not spend your time working with techniques with serious research support behind them? You will get placebo benefits and so much more. From a mental health aspect I thought to myself, don’t waste your time with quackery when there is great real treatment available. This made my own question about whether I should try something like acupuncture for its placebo benefit suddenly seem silly to me. I would never go to a quack for mental health treatment. Why would I do it for medical treatment? I will instead use things that have known scientific value such as meditation, healthy eating, and exercise and reap both any potential placebo value plus real value.  
  
self-healing and mind-body medicine: Jon Kabat-Zin, Full Catastrophe Living, states “But while it is entirely possible that practicing meditation and specific visualizations might significantly influence immune function and stimulate healing, that conjecture Is still far from proven at this time.” He also states that there is not enough research yet to “determine the relative importance of specific visualizations in the healing process compared with the simple practice of moment-to-moment awareness”.
He states that individuals who approach meditation for the purpose of some specific outcome such as becoming calmer or lowering their blood pressure, or improving immune function may sabotage the process be becoming too goal focused and missing the healing power of acceptance and non-doing. He discusses specific practices such as visualizations related to healing and stated these have their place; however if not placed in the context of non-doing can “too easily degenerate from meditation into wishful thinking”.  Kabat-Zin writes that in his experience symptom reduction is more likely to occur in the context of acceptance and non-doing. They may miss the larger context and thus the richness of learning a different way of being that can touch their life in ways far beyond that of simple symptom reduction. “To bring calmness to the mind and body requires that at a certain point we be willing to let go of wanting anything at qll to happen and accept things as they are”.  
Placebo: Prior to getting sick, I was certainly aware of the reality of the placebo effect. However, I didn’t give it much thought in my own life. As a result of my interactions with doctors and my exploration into the value of alternative treatments, I have tried to learn more about it. I first got to thinking about it when the psychiatrist that I saw made the assumption that I experienced severe withdrawals from Paxil because I had built up in my mind ahead of time that I would. In other words, he thought my expectations impacted my reaction, or perception of my reaction. As I have described above, I was taken aback by this because actually the opposite was true. I expected withdrawal to be relatively easy. I thought that as long as I tapered down slowly it would be no big deal. Instead the opposite occurred. My expectation did not match up with what happened. However, what was interesting to me was how strongly the doctor jumped on this explanation. Actually, that is a mild way of putting it. It felt like he had accused me of being gullible and stupid and I was insulted, actually furious. Upon reflection, I do think it was a stupid thing for him to say after briefly meeting me.  That is not the way to build rapport with people. However, after reading up more on the placebo effect, I can understand why he might consider that as an option. The placebo effect is no joke and everyone is susceptible to it. 
Ben Goldacre describes how placebo has been shown to be effective in many studies, primarily for symptoms reported subjectively by patients, such as pain. He also describes some examples of placebo being effective for conditions that are objectively measurable, such as weight loss, the success of pacemakers, vomiting during pregnancy and ulcer healing rates.  This means a condition does not have to be all in the mind for placebo to work. Also, the more elaborate the placebo, the stronger its effects. Additionally, he relayed a study that found subjects with medically unexplained symptoms who were told they had a clear diagnosis and would get better, were more likely to recover than those who were told the doctor did not know what was wrong. 
As I try to wrestle with how the placebo effect might be at play in my own life I draw to mind examples that seem to contradict it. When an ENT confidently diagnosed me with Cerebral Small Vessel Disease and equally confidently that he would fix me with the drug Trental, I thoroughly believed him. I was overjoyed. However, I got progressively worse after beginning the drug. When a friend told me the supplement Tumeric had changed their life in terms of fatigue, I took it with the assumption that it was likely a crock and a wild shot in the dark. However, I felt dramatically better for a couple of weeks. Then things worsened again. It seems like more often than not I have had the opposite response to my expectations. Of course it may be that the Trental did not work for me because it was the wrong medication for me and the placebo aspects of it being given were not strong enough to overcome my illness. The Tumeric may have had a real effect and then homeostatis won out. 
To seriously consider placebo in my own life I first had to get past my bias against it working on me. As described above I found it insulting to be told that my expectations were impacting my symptoms. It is understandable how I would feel his way. Ben Goldacre cited an article from The Lancet in 1954 where a doctor wrote that “for some unintelligent or inadequate patients, life is made easier by a bottle of medicine to comfort the ego.” There has been an assumption even amongst doctors that placebo works for conditions that are all in the mind and that they work primarily on simpletons. However, Goldacre also reports that it has been found that placebo works on everyone. It is universal and it works in real physiological ways on real medical conditions.  Goldacre reported some studies have shown that placebo actually triggers the same reaction in the body that a real drug would have. Parkinson’s patients receiving a placebo version of a drug designed to increase the neurotransmitter dopamine, actually had an increase in dopamine. So, this suggests something far beyond pure psychological factors is happening with the placebo effect.   
But I wonder, if the placebo effect is so powerful, is there more I could be doing to harness it? Would my condition have to have a strong psychological component for placebo to benefit me? Although I certainly do not think my condition is primarily psychological, it is impacted by stress. So, there must be some interface between the psychological and the physical. Rest and relaxation certainly have a calming effect on my symptoms, although do not eliminate them. I wonder, do alternative therapies such as acupuncture have something more to offer me if only in the form of placebo?   
My husband has pointed out that there are things I am doing that I believe in that could already be triggering placebo effects. For example, I meditate, walk my dog, do brief, gentle yoga, and eat more fruit and vegetables. I believe these things have real benefits; however they may also be triggering placebo benefits. He used this as an argument against bothering with treatments that likely have no benefit beyond placebo, especially since they cost money.
Ben Goldacre discusses how placebo may be a valid treatment to offer for individuals with symptoms that are not well served by conventional medicine, such as chronic pain and unexplained fatigue. However, one down side is the potential for people with genuinely treatable conditions to use alternative treatments INSTEAD of real medical treatments that they in fact need. He discusses how homeopaths have tended to recommended their treatments, which are nothing more than placebo, as a replacement for important things like vaccines. I can certainly see danger there; however since I would be using placebo/alternative treatments only because conventional medicine has no treatment to offer me, I don’t see the harm other than to my pocketbook. Of course I would only use treatments that have been shown to be mostly safe, such as acupuncture. I would not dabble in herbs than can have unknown side effects or treatments that induce vomiting. I would not trust a homeopath because they are in a profession that is actively dismissive of the value of conventional medicine. In other words, I would only dabble in placebo if there was no risk of harm.  
That leaves me with the question, if I know something is a placebo, will it induce placebo?
Although respected science writer like Ben Goldacre and Simon Singh discuss the benefits of placebo and some writers such as mind over medicine – writes glowingly about it; is it really so powerful? 
Placebo:
In 2004, Hrobjartsson, A and Gotzsche, PC of the Nordic Cochrane Center conducted a systematic review entitled, “Is the placebo powerless? A systematic review of 52 new randomized trials comparing placebo with no treatment”. The stated that in the 1950s it became widely believed that the placebo effect was highly powerful. This was based on numerous randomized trials that seemed to indicate it and also a paper written by Beecher entitled, “The Powerful Placebo”. However, in 1997 Kienle and Kiene revealed that Beecher’s paper in addition to the other reported trials supporting placebo’s power were flawed. This was because the trials did not have a no treatment group to compare the placebo group to. Thus there could have been other factors besides the administration of placebo that accounted for the observed changes. Examples are regression to the mean and spontaneous remission. In 2001, Hrobjartsson, A and Gotzsche, PC published a systemic review of 114 randomized clinical trials that compared placebo treated to no treatment groups. They found no support for significant placebo effects other than with subjective reports of pain. However, with these favorable findings, it appeared that bias could have explained them.  To assess whether these findings could be reproduced, they did another systematic review of trials published after their 2001 publication. They reviewed 42 new trials and found similar results. Placebo had no significant effect on binary outcomes, observer’s report of continuous outcomes. There was a significant effect on subject’s report of continuous outcomes such as perception of pain. However, again bias likely contributed to this. These were not blinded trials and patients tend to want to please the investigators by saying they have experienced a benefit when they have not. Also, although there was a statistically significant benefit regarding pain on continuous patient-reported outcomes, they were so small that it seems unlikely these would render clinically significant benefits. The researchers point out that although they found no significant effect of the placebo treatment itself, it is possible that patients in both the placebo and no treatment groups experienced benefits simply from factors such as the interaction with the investigators.  
In 2010, Hrobjartsson, A and Gotzsche, PC conducted another review of 202 clinical trials comparing placebo to no treatment groups across 60 different health conditions. They found similar results yet again. 
Not everyone found this convincing. Robert M. Sapolsky, a Stanford University professor of biology and neuroscience expressed irritation with the above 2001 study. In his book, “Why Zebras Don’t Get Ulcers”, he stated of the 114 studies included, any looked at conditions where you would not expect the placebo to work. They placebo in general was disregarded by any as being effective. However, as Sapolsky points out, it is effective for pain. In his book he describes why this is, stating that placebo triggers the release of endogenous opioids. He stated evidence for this is that if you block opiate receptors with naloxone then placebos no longer work. I found no reference for this statement, thus I could not look up the studies he is referring to.  Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche did address the issue of pain by stating that in those studies with positive results, bias could have explained them. What they are referring to is factors such as demand characteristics. This is that participants in research studies have a tendency to pick up on the expectations of the researchers and try to give them what they think the researchers want. In the studies on pain, the subjects knew they were in placebo groups, thus may have said they felt better simply to please the researchers.  And as already mentioned, writers such as Ben Goldacre and Simon Singh describe the placebo as being effective. 
Stewart-Williams and Podd of Massey University (2004 google scholar) have argued that Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche’s conclusions about the placebo effect are wrong. They state that no placebo researcher would argue that placebos are effective across all disorders. Yet Hrobjartsson and Gotzsche lump together in their meta-analyses studies looking at conditions that would be unlikely to be effected by the placebo effect with conditions that are likely impacted by placebo. Thus the significance of placebo appears smaller than it is. They also summarize numerous studies which found significant placebo effects and also specifically aimed to measure placebo effects and do so by including both a placebo trial and a no-treatment trial to minimize the effects of confounding variables. They point to studies which show both subjective and objective effects of placebo. 
The most researched and supported is the effect of placebo on improving subjective reports of pain (Amanzio & Benedetti 1999; De Pascalis et al 2002; Price et al 1999; Spanos et alo 1993). Other significant areas in which placebo has been found to trigger subjective changes is depression (Kirsch & Sapirstein 1999), arousal (Kirsch & Weixel 1988), and sedation (Jenson & Karoly 1991). Regarding objective effects of placebo, these have been found in the area of pain, asthma, and facial swelling. Regarding pain, it has been shown that the drug naloxone, which is known to block endorphin receptors, also blocks placebo analgesia (Benedetti & Amanzio 1997; Levine, Gordon, & Fields 1978). Regarding asthma, placebo inhaler use has been shown to induce bronchoconstriction in asthma patients (Butler & Steptoe 1986). Placebos have also been shown to reduce facial swelling following dental surgery (Ho et al 1988). They also identify that there is a debate within the area of placebo studies about how placebo works, either via classical conditioning or a more conscious, explicit expectation. They conclude that the answer is likely that both are at play and that they are not mutually exclusive. 
They define a placebo is a substance or procedure that has no inherent power to produce an effect that is sought or expected. They define a placebo effect is a genuine psychological or physiological effect, in a human or another animal, which is attributable to receiving a substance or undergoing a procedure, but is not due to the inherent powers of that substance or procedure. 
Additionally, Benedetti et al (2003) have indicated that there is significant support for the effect of placebo on Parkinson’s patients. Using PET scans, Fuente-Fernandez et al (2001) found that the expectation of receiving a drug known to release dopamine levels, levodopa, caused a release of dopamine. It should be noted that their sample size was only six. Benedetti et al (2003) compared three groups of Parkinson’s patients. They measured the velocity of hand movements while receiving stimulation to the brain with a subthalamic stimulator. One group had the stimulator turned off, one group had the investigators pretend to turn off the stimulator (the nocebo group) and one group received continuous stimulation (the control group). When the stimulator was actually turned off and when it was simulated that it was turned off, the patients hand movements similarly slowed down. There was no change with the control group. Again it should be noted the sample size was small and included only 10 patients.
Benedetti et al (2003) were also interested in distinguishing which conditions responded to placebo in the form of unconscious conditioning and which responded through conscious expectations. To assess this they looked at the effects of placebo on arm pain and hormone changes in healthy volunteers. They found that while the Parkinson’s patients motor movements and the healthy volunteers levels of arm pain were affected by verbal instructions (conscious expectation), hormone secretion levels were not. Whereas hormone secretions were effected when given a placebo medication after being preconditioned to experience hormone changes with a real medication. Thus, the researchers concluded some unconscious physiological processes such as changes in hormone levels are impacted by placebo only via unconscious conditioning not conscious verbal suggestion. 
In an article in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), entitled “It’s tiem to put the placebo out of our misery”, Robin Nunn states that because of a lack of a clear definition of what is placebo and clarity about what is being measured within placebo research, we can say nothing meaningful about it. Nunn states, “When placebo, or any other construct, can be virtually anything, then it just may turn out to be virtually nothing”. Even if there is a no treatment group compared to a placebo group it is not clear whether what is triggering the change is administration of a sham procedure or medication, interaction with a doctor or researcher, seeing people in white coats, or what. The no treatment control group would have to have everything done exactly the same as the placebo group minus the type of placebo that is being measured to determine what is what. 
Placebo:
David Gorski, M.D. gave an interesting talk at Skepticon 7 entitled, “The Central Dogma of Alternative Medicine”. He discussed how troubled he is that pseudoscience, or quackery, is infiltrating mainstream medicine. He stated quackery was once called alternative medicine, but now that it is being treated as if it is equal to science within many respectable institutions, it is called integrative medicine. Gorski calls this integrating science and magic.  One problem I have with this is that practices that have been scientifically validated to have benefits, at least in terms of mental health, such as mindfulness meditation and yoga are lumped in with ridiculous practices such as Reiki and homeopathy under the umbrella term “alternative” or “integrative” medicine.
 Gorski goes on to discuss the appearance of Kim Tinkham on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Kim was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. After reading the Secret, which was promoted by Oprah, she decided to forgo conventional medicine including surgery and instead pursue alternative treatments. The Secret discusses the Law of Attraction and asserts that the way we think about things and what we send out into the universe effects what happens to us. Quotes from the book include “thoughts become things” and “everything sent out returns to its source”. Tinkham then chose to follow Robert O. Young’s alkaline diet. Young claims that acid causes all cancer and that an alkaline diet is the cure. Young has also made statements such as “Your thoughts can effect your physiology” and “Thoughts become biology”. When Oprah learned about Kim’s choice to opt out of conventional treatment she had her on the show. Oprah stated that Kim was taking the statements from the Secret too far and was being irresponsible by rejecting what modern medicine had to offer her. Kim later died from her cancer.  
Gorski went on to say that the “Law of Attraction” or as he calls it “Wishing makes it so” is the central dogma of alternative medicine. That is within alternative medicine the idea that you must believe to be healed is pervasive. He points to a quote from the Secret, “Illness cannot exist in a body that has harmonious thoughts”. He states that treatments such as Reiki draw on this kind of thinking and are being used in respectable places such as the Cleveland Clinic. 
He mentions German New Medicine and its supposed five biological laws including such things as that “cancer originates from psychic trauma” and that confronting that trauma is the way to treat it. Also that “all diseases are rational and for your benefit”. In a nutshell Gorski says this is the assertion that cancer is psychosomatic. 
He also points to the overselling of the placebo effect by alternative practitioners. He stated that since studies have shown their treatments are no better than placebo, they now exaggerate the benefits of placebo as justification for the value of their treatments. However, Gorski states that regarding placebo, there is not as much there as is hyped. I will say more about this and the studies he mentions below. 
Gorski cites Andre Evans as another example of this problem. Evans says that “If you believe that your treatment is helping you, you could actually cause massive self-healing to occur”.
He discusses the overselling of the findings of epigenetics that is done by alternative practitioners. He uses the examples of Der Spiegel 2010 which gives the message that we can control our genes, making statements such as “How we can outwit our genomes”; Bruce Lipton who says our genes are controlled by our perceptions of the environment and that we are masters not victims; and Deepak Chopra who says “You will transform your own biology” and that epigenetics gives us “almost unlimited influence on our fate”. 
Gorski says this all boils down to “You must believe” and we buy it because humans have a strong need to have everything that occurs be explained. Gorski has witnessed this when he has had to give cancer diagnoses. He stated however, sometimes there are no answers to the why questions. He stated that the problem with ideas such as those promoted in the Secret are that it leads to blaming the victim. If its logic is followed then it suggests that Kim Tinkham died because she did not want to live and that Holocaust victims caused their own suffering. He cites a statement made by Robert O. Young after Kim Tinkham told him her cancer had spread, that “She felt embarrassed to tell me this news because she had not been living an alkaline diet”. Interestingly, Wikipedia says that “In 2014 Young was arrested in San Diego and received 18 felony charges relating to practising medicine without a license, and of theft.[28] According to the Medical Board of California's press release [29] chronically ill patients were paying Young up to $50,000 for his treatments.”
Gorski basically concludes that such alternative practitioners as described above capitalize on people’s childlike tendency to want the universe to make sense. People want to believe that if you want it badly enough you will get it.
A writer for Science Based Medicine, Harriet Hall, translated a French document written by Jean Brissonnet, entitled, “Placebo, Are You There?” This article reviewed the many different variables that could account for what researchers have traditionally lumped in to the category “placebo effect”. These include natural or spontaneous healing which is considered quite large for some conditions; regression to the mean; the Hawthorne effect; the Simpson’s Paradox; fluctuation of symptoms; another co-occurring treatment; politeness on the part of subjects, etc. The Hawthorne effect is the phenomenon in which research participants change their behavior simply because they are being studied. Regression to the mean is the tendency for extreme values measured at the beginning of a study to change over time to become closer to the average regardless of intervention. Simpson’s Paradox addresses how there can be variables called confounders that the researchers did not control for, that may be what is explaining any observed changes and not the research variables themselves. Researchers may discover these when analyzing subgroups of data and finding that this changes their results. These other variables are predicted to account for so much of what is seen in a placebo group, that it has been wondered whether the true placebo effect exists at all. The term placebo effect is therefore confusing. A change in terminology has been proposed, calling it contextual effects to account for all the factors that are present in a study that can influence outcomes other than the treatment itself. Natural healing would be considered something additional to contextual effects and treatment effects. Contextual effects have been broken down into three factors 1) therapeutic ritual (name, price, color, taste, means of administration);  2) environmental conditions (personality and beliefs of the patient, location of administration, etc; 3) the doctor patient relationship. Kaptchuk (2008) studied these 3 factors in patients with IBS. They looked at a wait list group, a placebo acupuncture group, and a placebo acupuncture group who was given sustained, warm attention from the provider. Their results were a 28% improvement in the wait list group (possibly due to natural healing); 44% in the placebo group (possibly due to the ritual and environmental factors; and a 62% improvement in those who received special attention, suggesting that it is the quality of the relationship with the provider which is most important.
In a study by Thomas (1997) of individuals with functional illnesses (those with no known organic explanation for physical symptoms) found no difference between those given no treatment or a placebo object. However, those who were given a specific diagnosis and told they would heal showed significant improvement over time compared to those who were given a lack of clarity regarding diagnosis and progression of the disease. This suggests the therapeutic encounter between doctor and patient is much more important than whether there is a placebo object. What has been referred to as the placebo effect can be generated by other factors unrelated to getting say a sugar pill. 
Most studies of the placebo effect are done in the area of pain and pain is the area in which placebo effects are most significant.
Petrovic et al (2002) gave volunteers a mild sunburn. Improvement in pain was reported amongst those in both a placebo group and those who received opioid analgesics. PET scans revealed changes in areas of the brain associated with pain relief. Then opioid blockers were administered and the improvements went away. Thus, there was a real physiological change happening in the body of those who responded to placebo.  
In a 2001 study by De La Fuente-Fernandez, PET scans showed Parkinson’s patients experienced a release in endogenous dopamine in when administered both placebo and levodopa. However, it is unclear whether these brain changes result in meaningful clinical changes. A study by Fregni et al (2006) found that there was no significant improvement on an objective measure of motor function in a placebo group whereas improvement was seen in those who received levodopa.
Beyond subjective perception, no such evidence of physical changes has been shown in the areas of infectious diseases or tumors.
It is argued that the issue of whether to use deception with patients to utilize the placebo effect is mute. This is because a placebo object is not necessary to utilize the contextual effects described above. Finiss et all (2010) writes that the placebo effect is associated with real psychobiological changes that can be attributed to the overall therapeutic context. 
Gorski’s blog entry “Placebo Effects Are Not “The Power of Positive Thinking”: Expresses concern that alt med is rebranding itself as using the powerful placebo which is in Gorski’s words no more than believing that “wishing makes it so”. Kaptchuk’s study showed asthma patients given sham acupuncture perceieved they were less short of breath; however objective measures showed they were not.  Proponents celebrated that the placebo is therapeutically useful in medicine. Gorski pointed out that this could be dangerous because the shortness of breath is an important signal that they need treatment. I understand this; however what about with conditions that are not signaling something that needs to be listened to and something than medicine cannot treat such as chronic pain. Gorski discusses how Kaptchuk’s claims that placebo works without deception is wrong. The following study claims to have found this. However, there was strong suggestion that placebo pills will ease pain in the informed consent. Study of placebo effects with migraine sufferers: No treatment: 15% worsening of pain; Known placebo: 26% decrease in pain; Placebo labeled maxalt: 25% decrease; Maxalt labeled placebo: 36% decrease; Mystery pill: 40% decrease; Known maxalt: 40% decrease. There was no statistically significant difference in pain reduction between the placebo labeled maxalt or the maxalt labeled placebo. Maxalt worked better than placebo only when the participants knew that is what they were takingor they thought it was possible that was what they were taking. Otherwise maxalt performed no better than placebo. And placebo was better than nothing. After 2.5 hours the percentage of patients who were pain free was measured. There was no statistical difference between the no treatment and placebo labeled groups. Those in the maxalt groups were 4 times as likely to report no pain than those in the placebo groups.  Gorski points out that placebo effects are most significant with subjective endpoints such as decrease in pain and no so effective with hard endpoints such as pain vs pain free. Although Gorski’s point in writing about this is to highlight how Kaptchuk oversells placebo; my take away from this is that if I had chronic pain specifically, I would be open to pursuing placebo treatments to give me some relief. However, I also see that there is not much to say about placebo beyond such subjective and non-critical conditions. If the condition is not signaling something I need to know about and a placebo intervention can improve my perception (alone) of the condition, why not utilize it? I do not need to be deceived, because research supports placebo can have benefits. So, I could be told I was being given placebo or I might use a placebo treatment such as acupuncture and I would expect some benefit.  
The danger of false hope: Study with elderly and loneliness – got worse after visitors left than were before. 
I certainly understand the frustration that comes across when reading critics of alternative medicine about such things as how practitioners often discourage the use of conventional treatments. I personally would never start my search for treatment options within the alternative realm. With any condition I would start my search for help in the conventional realm. I think ignoring effective treatments, especially for life threatening conditions such as cancer or HIV is frankly, nuts. But when it comes to the kinds of conditions conventional medicine either has nothing to offer or the treatments are risky such as using large amounts of highly addictive drugs to treat chronic pain, I am more open to what some alternative practitioners have to offer. I would never bother with treatments that seem to me to be complete foolishness such as homeopathy. However, with something like acupuncture, where there are studies that suggest possible positive outcomes for specific conditions, particularly pain, I think it makes sense to give it a whirl. Even if it is merely a powerful vehicle for triggering the placebo response, why not utilize that? Ernst points out two dangers when considering utilizing treatments that are mere placebo. First, you may miss out on treatments with actually therapeutic efficacy. As I stated above, I would only use alternative therapies if there was nothing available or relatively safe offered by conventional medicine. Second, some alternative treatments are dangerous. Again, I would only use those shown to have very low risk. As Ernst’s own research team concluded, acupuncture is very low risk of harm. Even if the placebo response it not all proponents claim it is, if it were to provide me any relief if struggled with chronic pain, then bring it on. Ernst also criticizes alternative medicine proponents for claiming they offer more compassionate care (time, kindness, a listening ear) whereas conventional medicine does not. Ernst states that conventional doctors are just as capable of offering compassionate care and they offer effective treatments. However, my experience of most conventional medicine environments is that the doctors do not display anything like the kindness and patience I have experienced with the acupuncturist I once say. Additionally, his office lighting was warm and inviting. The office was decorated warmly. There was soothing music playing. In some offices you may encounter tinkling water fountains. Some conventional practitioners may be dismissive of such things. I chose the primary care physician who ended up having a horrible beside manner mentioned above, because the women’s health clinic where she worked advertised itself as offering pleasant, soothing environment of care. In fact the office was all that. It looked like a spa. I found this comforting. However, when I commented on this to the PCP she stated with disdain that she thought it was pointless and wasteful. Such things may not bring about medical cures. However, if there is something to the non-specific effects that are controlled for in clinical trials such as doctor-patient relationships, then why would such factors not matter? As pointed out by Ernst, being a patient encountering the often cold medical establishment can be traumatic. Being in an environment that suggests caring and comfort can ease this and matters to me.n Conventional practitioners could offer this, but in my experience, mostly don’t. I certainly did not encounter any of these benefits at the Mayo Clinic. So in my experience, until conventional medicine gives doctors the time to treat patients compassionately and seriously promotes good bedside manner and offers less cold, clinical environments of care, the alqternative medicine doctors have something superior to offer in this one arena. OF course this is not enough on its own if you have a medically treatable condition. But if you do not, this kind of care and attendance to environment should not be casually dismissed and the alternative practitioners who offer this completely dismissed.  My husband argues for concerns about a slippery slope. That exposing yourself to basically, charlatans, who only have placebo to offer, this is stepping into dangerous territory. But as someone who lives with frequently bouts of excrutiating headache pain, I just don’t care. And even though I know acupuncture is likely mere placebo, thus the possibility of deception is not available to me, I should still benefit because I believe in the placebo. Even if I know that is what I am getting, if I believe it is effective in and of itself, why would I not benefit?  
Whereas some mind-body proponents like Herbert Benson emphasize the need to believe you will get better; much of the writings on coping with chronic illness that I have read emphasize a need to come accept your condition is chronic and thus will always be with you. You are not going to get better. I don’t think I need to embrace either of these fully. I am more comfortable with what Buddhist writers such as Pema Chodron emphasize, life is ever changing and unpredictable and we can embrace this. We can relax into it. She emphasizes the value of letting go of delusions and trying to fully see and be open to the reality of life. I prefer this approach as I value truth. Thus, I feel comfortable with, and that it is most truthful to say, that I might get better and I might not. There is no way to know for sure what the future holds. There is much we do not know about chronic illness and thus there is the possibility of advancements in medicine in the future. It is also possible to experience spontaneous remission. I do not need to say that I will never get better to cope. I also do not need to say that I will get better because it is ok if I do not. If I get better or I don’t, I will be okay. I think this is the sanist approach. 


Chapter Four Human gullibility
As I stated in the chapter on mind-body medicine, people in my life seem to have a strong need to know why I got sick. Some have posited psychological explanations, such as that it was stress induced. Others come up with more religious explanations for illness. One person who had a sick family member wondered why God was doing this to them. Another person I know who has chronic illness finds it comforting to think in karmic terms and believes they did something in a past life to bring their illness on. This led me to wonder, why do people need clear explanations for why illness happens? Why do they need to believe that a cure is out there? It can be a way for healthy individuals to distance themselves from my situation by thinking that with the right healthy lifestyle or moral living they can avoid being in my shoes. It involves the illusion of control. They cannot accept that sometimes, shit just happens. 

Why is science so important? Because we can be highly irrational beings. In part due to our legitimate need to try to make sense of our complex world, cognitive and social psychologists have shown that we are subject to errors in thinking and judgment. We jump to conclusions (correlation is not causation). We oversimplify things.
Look up March 2008 Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience stated “Something about seeing neuroscience information may encourage people to believe they have received a scientific explanation when they have not (Goldacre references this to discuss cog bias). 
Goldacre mentions the Literature on irrationality: 
* “People tend to rate longer explanations as being more similar to experts explanations”
* The Seductive details effect: If you present related (but logically irrelevant details to people as part of an argument, this seems to make it more difficult for them to encode, and later refcall, the main argument of a text, because their attention is diverted.

I have directly observed that some mental health practitioners are dismissive of scientific improvements being made within the field of psychology. They cling to their own outdated therapeutic styles. They may make postmodernist claims about the limitations of science. However, I have seen such therapists keep their clients stuck for years seeing them continually despite no evidence of improvement. Whereas I have seen these same clients switch to a therapist who is skilled at using evidence-based treatments with resulting dramatic improvement. Example, Monkey Mind. Thankfully, the VA system from which I came has put forth enormous effort to train its workforce in evidence-based practices. Being dismissive of science may be due to laziness or for proponents of lucrative pseudoscience practices, it may be straight up greed. 

Orac writes “Knowledge versus certainty in skepticism, medicine and science: “If there is one universal trait amongst humans, it seems to be an unquenchable thirst for certainty”. This desire conflicts with the nature of science, which is open to changing based on new evidence. He writes “When scientific evidence meets a strong belief, the evidence usually loses”. As social psychologist Robert MacCoun points out, humans have a tendency to gravitate to studies that support their beliefs and dismiss those that challenge them as being poorly conducted. In a study by Geoffrey D. Munro of Towson University in Maryland that appeared in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology under the title of The Scientific Impotence Excuse: Discounting Belief-Threatening Scientific Abstracts. The authors found that when confronted with scientific evidence that conflicts with one’s beliefs, people tend to decide that science is impotent in terms of studying that particular subject. Additionally, people who have this experience are then more likely to think science is impotent in general. 
Why are people so quick to offer remedies when we get sick? For one thing, they care and want us to feel better. But sometimes it relates to our human desire for security, certainty, and control. We want things to be predictable, to have clear cause and effect relationships that we can understand and manipulate. This becomes particular true when considering the possibility of losing our health and of course when facing the concept of our mortality. In a blog on Scient-Based Medicine, Dr. Gorski discusses how uncomfortable it is to give someone a cancer diagnosis and then inevitably be faced with questions about what caused it. Dr. Gorski explains that with cancer, especially his specialty breast cancer, there is little that is known about causes. Yet he stated that people do not want to hear, “We just don’t know”. 
I think one reason some do this is because as Buddhist writer Pema Chodron describes, we have a difficult time accepting the fundamental ambiguity of human existence. Life is not certain and is ever changing and yet we want it to be the opposite. Because of our longing for security and certainty we have a hard time seeing and embracing life as it truly is. This will be discussed in more detail later on. 
Additionally, I think that because of our desire for security we tend to embrace extremes when it comes to our beliefs that comfort us. We like to say “My way is the right way” and shut down to the possibility of complexity. We can see this obviously in the world of religion and politics. And it can be seen in the world of health topics. Vegans say their way is the right way. Paleos say theirs is right. Some say Western medicine is bad, alternative medicine is good. Pharmaceuticals are always bad. Some lifestyle gurus say that lifestyle is to blame for disease. If you thought right or ate right you would not get sick. On the other end of this continuum are those who say that lifestyle doesn’t matter, it is all up to our genes or luck so why bother? Some obese individuals may do this. 
Instead, I think the truth is often less knowable than we would like to believe or it is more complex. Lifestyle might play a significant role in certain diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease and not so much in others like cancer. But we love to embrace simplistic, all or none kinds of explanations. I think that often a middle way that involves holding the tension between extremes is a wiser approach to life. However, if embraced to simplistically this could also be a form of absolutism. Sometimes extremes are the answer. For example, I tried to be open minded to what alternative medicine had to offer, reasoning that both scientific medicine and alternative medicine have good things to offer. But as I researched alternative treatments like acupuncture I had to have to courage to see that research has fairly clearly debnunked it as not better than placebo. I then had to be willing to change my views if I wanted to get closer to the truth. Even if this meant letting go of hope and the comfort that comes from a childish belief in magic and not looking behind the curt
The importance of good science:   
My training in psychology has taught me that human thought, while amazing, can be frought with error. There are many examples of this found within cognitive and social psychology research.
In his book, “Thinking Fast and Slow”, Daniel Kahneman describes the process by which he and Amos Tversky discovered and developed their ideas about how vulnerable we all are to errors in thinking. They initially suspected that people’s intuitive judgments, while useful much of the time, was also prone to error. It is often based on heuristics, or rules of thumb, that overly simplify the world for us. “A simple procedure that helps find adequate, though often imperfect, answers to difficult questions” (17%). They conducted numerous experiments which supported their suspicion.  They published their findings in their highly influential 1982 paper, “Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases”. Their groundbreaking research has greatly influenced the fields of psychology and economics. 
Kahneman states that we have two different systems by which we form judgments and make decisions. The first system, he calls System 1, draws on intuition and makes quick, snap judgments with little to no deliberate thought process. This system is used with ease and most of its workings are outside of our conscious awareness. System 2 is deliberate, effortful, slow, and more rationale. We use System 1 the most in part because, “laziness is built deep into our nature”. However, System 1 is also far more vulnerable to error. Kahneman states, “You believe you know what goes on in your mind, which often consists of one conscious thought leading in an orderly way to another. But that is not the only way the mind works, nor indeed is that the typical way”. In other words, we tend to assume System 2 is in control, and this is not usually the case.
He and Amos turned the microscope on themselves and began checking out their own intuitive judgments about their own research. Although they were both expert scientists, they found that they were prone to believing research findings without adequate evidence. They expanded their view and found that their colleagues did the same. 
Using System 1, “you often have answers to questions that you do not completely understand, relying on evidence that you can neither explain nor defend. He describes many of the systematic errors, also called biases, that all of us tend to make when we are using System 1.  
The representativeness heuristic: We tend to make predictions about people based on their resemblance to a stereotype. This often leads to mistakes. 
The availability heuristic: We rely on information or memories that come to mind easily when forming judgments about the frequency of events and do not realize how biased this can be. This shows up when people are asked to weigh the significance of current events. “People tend to assess the relative importance of issues by the ease with which they are retrieved from memory-and this is largely determined by the extent of coverage in the media”.  Dramatic events that grab your attention tend to come to mind more easily later on. This biases your view of how often such event occur. Kahneman provides examples such as the frequency we tend to believe Hollywood divorces, political sex scandals, and plane crashes occur. This is also true for events that happen to you versus to others
The error of substitution: When a difficult question presents itself, we often unconsciously substitute an easier question and answer it instead. This shows itself when people have to choose a candidate for whom to vote. Whereas they should consider information such as where the candidate stands on issues and their voting record, they may instead answer the question, “Who is more likeable?” and base this in no evidence beyond gut reactions.  This is also an example of the affect heuristic. That is the tendency to make judgments based on emotions, such as unconsciously asking oneself, “How do I feel” about something versus “What do I think?”. These judgments are also easily swayed. In a study by Paul Slovic, people’s beliefs about the riskiness of a technology was altered simply by being told about its benefits and given no relative evidence. Kahneman states, “The affect heuristic simplifies our lives by creating a world that is much tidier than reality”. He also states that Slovic’s work “offers a picture of Mr. and Ms. Citizen that is far from flattering: guided by emotion rather than by reason, easily swayed by trivial details, and inadequately sensitive to differences between low and negligibly low probabilities”.
The priming effect: When exposed to a word or idea, other related words or ideas are much more likely to come to mind. For example, a study showed that people were more likely to support increased funding for schools if their polling station was located in a school. They had been primed to tune in to the issue. 
Illusions of truth: People are more likely to believe something if it is familiar to them, is processed with ease, and is told to them by someone they like. Kahneman points out that marketers and authoritarian institutions manipulate this by using things such as repetition and celebrities. People are more likely to buy stocks with easily pronounceable names. 
Illusion of causality: We like it when things make sense. We tend to read in causal explanations for things even when there are none. We generate stories with cause and effect relationships. The stories we come up with are largely generated by System 1, that is, outside of our conscious awareness. System 2 then believes the explanations generated by System 1. These stories are often wrong. Kahneman states, “Our predilection for causal thinking exposes us to serious mistakes in evaluating the randomness of truly random events.” We are so uncomfortable with the idea of randomness, that Kahneman and Amos found that many people rejected their findings. For example, when their research revealed that the belief in a “hot streak” in basketball was nothing more than random events, their findings were rejected by the basketball industry. Kahneman states, “We are far too willing to reject the belief that much of what we see in life is random” and we have a “view of the world around us that is simpler and more coherent than the data justify. Jumping to conclusions is a safer sport in the world of our imagination than it is in reality”. 
Wrongly equating correlation with causation: It is a statistical certainty that when the correlation between two measures is less than perfect, regression to the mean will occur. Another way to think about this is that when we measure things, over time they will move towards what is their average. If you are having difficulty understanding this, you are not alone. Kahneman says this concept is difficult to understand because we are so drawn to causal explanations for what we observe that we have difficulty accepting mere statistical ones. Kahneman provides an example. If you read in the news, “Depressed children treated with an energy drink improve significantly over a three-month period”, most of you would assume that this meant the energy drink caused the improvement. However, it is statistically likely that depressed children will improve significantly without any intervention because of regression to the mean. I think we can all think of numerous examples of how people make similar errors. It could explain much about phenomenon such as faith healing and other pseudoscientific interventions seeming to work in improving people’s health. This is why control groups are used in experiments, to see if a treatment group changes beyond mere regression to the mean. Kahneman points out that even famous researchers make the mistake of reading in causal meaning to mere correlational data. 
Bias of confidence over doubt: We tend to prefer certainty over doubt. Doubting takes effort and embracing certainty is easier. Because of this we tend to embrace with confidence that we know more than we do. We piece together meaningful stories about how things are based on little evidence. One example of this is the halo effect. We have a tendency to think we understand others well when we actually know very little about them. We tend to see patterns in random events. For example, drawing conclusions about data drawn from small samples sizes is not a good idea; however even experienced researchers tend to do it. It is problematic because extreme outcomes are more likely to be found in amongst small groups of numbers, even though these outcomes are based on mere chance. With larger samples these random extreme events tend to average out and then if patterns do emerge they become more meaningful. 
Jumping to conclusions: System 1 jumps to conclusions based on limited evidence. System 1 believes what you see is all there is to the story. Our tendency to jump to conclusions shows up in numerous ways.
* Suppressed ambiguity: When we are uncertain about things, System 1 often kicks in and offers and answer which is largely based on our experience and does not take into account alternate explanations. We are not aware that we have done this. 
* Confirmation bias: System 1 is gullible. It is drawn to information that confirms what it already believes even if highly unlikely. Doubting, or questioning things is more of a function of System 2. 
* The halo effect: When we like or dislike one thing about someone, we tend like or dislike everything about them, even things we do not know anything about. 
* Overconfidence: Neither the quality or quantity of the evidence that we have access to concerns us within the realm of intuition or System 1. If the story makes sense, we tend to believe it unquestioningly.
The judgment heuristic: CH People often draw conclusions about others, based on superficial assessments. For example, research has shown that voters tend to choose candidates for office based on whether their faces look strong and trustworthy (strong jawline, slight smile). They substitute a difficult assessment for one made more easily.   
Overconfidence: 
The Illusion of Understanding: 
Narrative Fallacy: In his book, The Black Swan, Nassim Taleb shared his observations about the human tendency to create stories that explain the past that are often faulty and then use those flawed stories to try and predict the future. We do not realize these stories are faulty and tend to believe them as fact. We do this so that the world appears to make sense to us. We like to think that we know why things happened. 
Similarly, we like to think we can make sense of other people’s behavior by attributing it their personality traits. Then we can neatly explain things in terms of cause and effect. This relates to our use of the halo effect. We think we can explain everything about a person based on one attribute that caught our attention. We comfort ourselves by thinking we can place people in categories and then predict their future behavior, such as labeling someone as good and then believing everything they do will be good. When we label someone as bad we tend to believe they are all bad. 
Kahneman states, “You cannot help dealing with the limited information you have as if it were all there is to know.” And “Our comforting conviction that the world makes sense rests on a secure foundation: our almost unlimited ability to ignore our ignorance”.
Hindsight bias: Coined by Baruch Fischhoff, is the belief that we always knew what we know now. We find it difficult to recall how we felt or viewed things before we had all the information we have at a later date. This is something psychologists learn to recognize and address in combat Veterans. They beat themselves up for not preventing tragic events. This is because they believe they somehow should have known the outcome of an event before it happened and thus feel guilty if they were unable to save a fellow soldier. They assume they must have been able to access all the information they now have looking back. If they can come to see that they could not possibly have known then what they know now they can come to drop the self-blame.
In his book, The Halo Effect, Philip Rosenzweig describes how we crave certainty and thus will assume that if a company is successful, its CEO must have good attributes. If it then fails we assume that same CEO must have bad attributes. We do not want to believe the companies’ success or failure had to do with luck and that the CEO had little control. Kahneman states, “the human mind needs a simple message of triumph and failure that identifies clear causes and ignores the determinative power of luck and the inevitability of regression”.
The Illusion of Validity: We have a tendency to believe we can make predictions about the future even when it is based on weak evidence and even when we are shown evidence to the contrary. Kahneman describes how this applies to stock brockers and political commentators. He states, “There is general agreement among researchers that nearly all stock pickers, whether they know it or not-and few of them do-are playing a game of chance. The subjective experience of traders is that they are making sensible educated guesses in a situation of great uncertainty.” When he presented his research to a particular firm of stock brockers, they acknowledged his findings and simply moved on with business as usual, with no dent in their confidence. He explained this phenomenon partly as being due to the fact that these brokers were using high level skills, thus they felt as if they knew what they were doing. However, the skills they were using were not the ones necessary for the job of predicting the market and choosing stocks. However, their skill at the part of their job they actually could control such as “examining income statements” made them feel as if they were skilled at the part of the job that really mattered and was in fact, not within their control.  Additionally, the entire industry goes along with it and as Kahneman states, “people can maintain an unshakable faith in any proposition, however absurd, when they are sustained by a community of like-minded believers”. Regarding political pundits, he stated that research has shown that because of their overconfidence at predicting the unpredictable, they perform worse than “dart-throwing monkeys”. Kahneman summarizes by stating that the problem is that although we do not want to believe it, the world is unpredictable, and a strong feeling of confidence should not be trusted to be accurate. 
In the book, “On Second Thought: Outsmarting Your Mind’s Hard-Wired Habits”, Wray Herbert writes about the topic of heuristics. This is our tendency to take “mental shortcuts” to make decisions. Heuristics are typically helpful as we would not be able to function if we thought intently about everything we did throughout the day. Heuristics help us function in a complex world. However, they are also “imperfect and often irrational”. Here is a mere sampling of them. One is the familiarity heuristic. This is our tendency to assume that if “something comes quickly to mind, trust it”, or familiar equals good. Another is the naturalistic heuristic. This is the human tendency to equate natural with good. Regarding the topic of this book, the naturalistic heuristic is one reason the alternative medicine movement is so strong. People have a tendency to believe if it came from nature (i.e. herbs) it is good. If it is synthetic (pharmaceuticals) it is bad. Wray provides lots of examples of how nature can be bad and how synthetic things can be good. Another is the design heuristic. We tend to opt for simplistic interpretations of complex phenomenon. We like for things to make sense. One way we do this is to create categories and then place things in these categories. When it comes to health issues, I have noticed that people want a clear and simple explanation for why I am sick and if it is not offered they confidently fill in the gap themselves. There are many, many more heuristics and Wray provides disturbing examples of how they are all fraught with problems. The scientific method provides a crucial means for us to see beyond the trap that is our mind’s tendency to oversimplify, to jump to conclusions.   
In addition to our use of heuristics, cognitive psychologists have also discovered many other errors in human thinking. Memory is a big one. 
Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias manifesting in two principal ways: unskilled individuals tend to suffer from illusory superiority, mistakenly rating their ability much higher than is accurate, while highly skilled individuals tend to rate their ability lower than is accurate. In unskilled individuals, this bias is attributed to a metacognitive inability of the unskilled to recognize their ineptitude. Conversely, people with true ability tend to underestimate their relative competence, erroneously assuming that tasks which are easy for them are also easy for others. (Thomas says not well studied). I think this shows up in the area of chronic illness when others assume they know such things as what is wrong with you (i.e. it is psychological because you can’t have babies); why you got sick (i.e. your job was too stressful); what will fix you (i.e. tapping, diet, etc).
The illusion of control: Psychologists have found that people tend to think believe they have more control over events than they do. The term was first coined by Ellen Langer in the 1970s and then replicated in numerous other studies. Langer has defined it as “an expectancy of a personal success probability inappropriately higher than the objective probability would warrant”. Langer has also stated, “while people may pay lip service to the concept of chance, they behave as though chance events are subject to control”. Langer identifies some reasons this may occur. She states 1) “people are motivated to control their environment” and 2) “There is motivation to avoid the negative consequences that accompany the perception of having no control”. She goes on to say that basically, feeling a loss of control freaks people out. Over the years there has been much debate within the field about whether types of coping that include positive illusions, such as the illusion of control, and defensive strategies, such as denial and avoidance, promote well-being or not. Researchers such as Taylor and Brown have argued they are a good thing. Whereas, humanistic psychologists such as Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow have asserted that moving towards psychological growth means in part letting go of illusions and defenses. Growth also occurs when one is fully aware of their sensory, visceral, and emotional experiences. Research has generally supported that avoidance coping has negative results. Knee and Zuckerman (1998) found that people who are more self-determined, that is more aware of their own needs and wants as opposed to those who act based on what they perceive as pressure from others, show less tendency to use positive illusions and defensive coping strategies. For example, they are less prone to using the self-serving bias which is a tendency to take credit when things go well and blame others when things go wrong. This is suggested to be because their self-esteem is less vulnerable to failures. They are more prone to simply see reality as it is instead of putting a self-serving spin on it. This has been labeled as the “nondefensive personality”. Kasser and Ryan (1996) and Sheldon and Kasser (1995) have shown that self-determined individuals are healthier.  
I think the desire to believe in pseudoscientific treatments such as those I reviewed in the last four chapters have to do with the desire for control and false hope. But the control and hope they bring are illusory. Some would prefer to have illusory control and false hope than to accept reality. However, for myself, I have found that acceptance of reality, though difficult, is the path to greater peace in the long run. This is because when coping via avoidance of reality, there is a sense of fear present, possibly unconcious, that reality will break through and one will not be able to bear it. Whereas, when reality is faced, there are no hidden monsters to fear lurking under the surface.   
The just world hypothesis:
Memory is an area rich with error. Eye witness testimony. False childhood memory psychology.

Social psychology has revealed numerous errors in thinking about ourselves and others. The Fundamental Attribution Error is the name for our tendency to assume that when others do something, it is due to something stable and inherent to them, such as something about their personality vs some temporary external event. I wonder if this relates to why doctors, family and friends might jump to conclusions about someone with an invisible chronic illness as being sick due to psychological problems, such as that they are a “hysterical female” or “Type A personality” or “a pessimist” or “too sensitive to handle stress”. I have to admit that before becoming sick, I can think of times when I did this. When someone became ill I would look for something about them to explain why it happened vs that it was random bad luck. We want there to be good reasons that might help us feel protected from bad things happening to us. 
The Fundamental Attribution Error is also called the Correspondence Bias. Gilbert and Malone (1995) pointed out that the tendency to attribute the behavior of others to their dispositions that we do so “even when a logical analysis suggests they should not” and when “situational forces explain the behavior quite nicely”. For example, in a study by Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz (1977), basketball players were randomnly assigned to shoot free throws on either well lit or poorly lit courts. Observers tended to attribute the players performance to their overall capability and ignore the lighting issues. In a study by Gilbert, Pelham, and Krull (1988), research participants observed some students receiving good news and some receiving bad news. They then tended to assume those they observed receiving bad news were also more chronically depressed and ignored the situation (receiving bad news). In one foundational experiment on the topic conducted by Jones and Harris (1967), research participants were shown essays that either were for or against Fidel Castro. They were told that the authors of the essays were either free to determine which side to argue for or that the authors were instructed by a debate coach to argue for a particular side. When told the author was free to choose, the participants of course believed the author must strongly agree with the side they argued for. However, surprisingly, they assumed the same even when they were told the author was instructed to argue for whichever side the supported in their essay. The participants explained this with statements such as “Well, yes, I know he was merely completing the assignment given him by his debate coach, but to some degree I think he personally believes what he wrote”. They simply could not accept that the author was simply responding to the situation and felt compelled to conclude something more enduring and personal about the author’s belief system. This observer bias as coined by Jones and Harris, has been replicated by numerous other studies. Over time social psychologists came to recognize that people have a strong tendency to underestimate the role of situational factors and overestimate the role of personality factors in determining people’s behaviors.  
They also point out that at least when they wrote in 1995, there was no agreement about the cause of this bias. One explanation espoused by Heider (1958) is that it helps individuals feel a greater sense of power over their world. Heider wrote, “Man grasps reality, and can predict and control it, by referring transient and variable behavior and events to relatively unchanging underlying conditions, the so-called dispositional properties of his world”. Thus enables people to believe they can predict other’s behaviors and thus feel more in control of the world. Gilbert and Malone state that it is a sort of “wishful thinking”. They site numerous studies that support the idea that when the observer has a strong need for control, they are more likely to attribute other’s behaviors to their personality. They also assert that Western culture has contributed to this tendency because of the value it places on the sense of individual control over one’s environment even when it may be illusory.  
The Actor-Observer Bias means that when we assess our own behavior, we tend to assume that we do things because of situational and external factors.
The Self-Serving Bias is the name for our tendency to interpret good things that happen to us as stemming from our own actions (we take credit) whereas we interpret bad things that happen, failures, as being due to situational factors beyond our control.  
In a review of the literature within the area of what is called defensive-attributions, Burger (1981) writes that as already stated humans are constantly searching for causal explanations for things that occur and that their perceptions of causality are often distorted by their desire to satisfy their own personal motivations. Burger states that Heider (1958) and Kelley (1971) have laid out the theory for this assertion. When confronted with tragic events such as natural disasters, disease, crime, and accidents that may be random events, people have a tendency to search for causal explanations. Research has shown a tendency to want someone to blame. Sometimes that is others and other times, it is oneself. For example, parents of dying children and rape victims have a tendency to blame themselves in an attempt to take the randomness and lack of predictability out of the equation. This helps people to feel they somehow have control and will have control over future events. 
Burger points to Walster (1966) who states that “as the magnitude of the misfortune increases…it becomes more and more unpleasant to acknowledge that “this kind of thing could happen to anyone”. Such an admission implies a catastrophe of similar magnitude could happen to YOU. If we can categorize a serious accident as in some way the victim’s fault, it is reassuring. We then simply need to assure ourselves that we are a different kind of person from the victim, or that we would behave differently under similar circumstances, and we feel protected from catastrophe”. Walster’s theory became known as the defensive-attribution hypothesis, which is basically that the more severe an accident, the more likely it is that others will blame the perpetrator of the accident. He tested and found support for his hypothesis. However, others had difficulty replicating it, specifically when looking at perpetrator’s of accidents. Later it was discovered that this is because there are moderating variables involved. If people perceive that they are different from the perpetrator of an accident, and that it is a situation unlikely to happen to them, then they will tend to blame the perpetrator. If they perceive the perpetrator as similar to them and that the event could happen in their lives, they tend to say that the perpetrator is not to blame. This was interpreted to mean that they do this in the hopes that they would not be blamed for similar events.   
Such aspects of attributional theory are similar to the just-world hypothesis. Early in his career, psychologist, Melvin Lerner, made some observations that led to his development of the just-world hypothesis. He noticed that generally smart and kind-hearted therapists working with mentally ill patients facing dire living situations would tend to harass and deride the patients for not doing more to improve their situation. He noticed a friend and physician, well known to have no tolerance for sad stories, such as movies with sad endings, coped with working at a pediatric hospital by assuming she could cure all the patients. When confronted with the reality of those whom she could not, those who were dying, she would avoid them as much as possible. When working with bright and caring students, he observed that when these students were confronted with the harsh circumstances of the lives of coal miners, they tended to insist that such individuals caused their own pitiful fate. For those on welfare, they insisted they were lazy and could find jobs if they wanted. Despite a careful presentation of evidence to the contrary provided by Lerner, the students did not budge in their views (Lerner, 1980). 
Lerner, Melvin J. (1980). The belief in a just world: a fundamental delusion. New York: Plenum Press, pp. 1-7. 
All these experiences led Lerner to wonder why otherwise kind individuals either derogated or ignored innocent others who were suffering. He went on to develop the theory called Belief in a Just World. That is, that humans have a strong need to believe that the world is orderly and just and that basically, people get what they deserve. Innocent victims present a threat to this belief. Lerner demonstrated within numerous studies ranging from 1965 and 1970, that to preserve these beliefs, humans will “belittle” and even “scorn” innocent victims (Lerner, 1998).
Montada, L. & Lerner, M. J. (1998). Responses to victimization and belief in a just world. New York: Plenum Press, pp. 9.
Gruman and Sloan (1983) applied Lerner’s theory specifically to individuals suffering from physical illness. They found that research participants in their study tended to derogate sick people’s character. The sicker people were the more the participants would derogate them. Referring to the Just-World Theory they argued that the sick are blamed for their illness because believing that the illness occurred due to random bad luck would mean that it could happen to anyone. To feel protected from this threat, people view the sick in a way that protects their view that good things happen to good people and bad things happen only to bad people. The way they tend to do this is the view the sick as having character flaws that caused the illness. They also pointed to the writings of Sontag (1978) who similar to Lerner argued that people need to believe the world is ordered and that they are in control. What appears to be random infliction of illness threatens this belief. In an attempt to cope, says, Sontag, victims of illness are sometimes blamed for their misfortune via derogating their personality characteristics. Sontag wrote, “Widely believed psychological theories of disease assign to the ill the ultimate responsibility for falling ill and for getting well”. 
Within the realm of science itself, researchers have to learn how to design studies that eliminate bias as much as possible. They also have to learn how to properly interpret their results without letting bias run amuck. When designing a study one important issue is to minimize the influence of factors other than what you are studying. This hard. However, how often in practical life do we jump to conclusions about something causing something else without considering all the possibilities? Regarding interpreting statistical results of a study, it was drilled into me that correlation does not equal causation. This means that two variables can be statistically shown to be related. For example, the more you do x then the stronger or weaker y becomes. It is tempting to then assume that x has a causative relationship with y. However, researchers know that there are things called confounding variables and mediating effects than can confuse the picture. This is why the scientific method is so critical. When there is a desired effect, we tend to make assumptions about what caused the effect. So, if someone say uses the logic that “I feel better since I went on this new diet”, this does not mean that the diet caused the improvement. In science there is something called confounding variables. To do our best at getting to the truth, we must use careful research methods. That is we must thing about how to go about asking the questions we want to ask in a way that eliminates as much confounding information as possible. Then after conducting a good experiment, preferably a double blind randomized controlled trial, we must be careful in how we interpret our data. We must not read in things that are not there, particularly being hasty in drawing causal conclusions. And the true test of whether things are scientifically meaningful is whether they can be replicated.

Mindfulness
“Bringing the mind back home” –Sogyal Rinpoche
“The awareness that arises by paying attention on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally” Jon Kabat-Zinn (Full Catastrophe Living p. xxxv)
Without realizing it at the time, my experience with mindfulness began when I was a graduate student via developing a yoga practice. This would have been about ten years ago. A friend invited me to attend a class with her and I immediately fell in love with it. I continued to go back on my own on a regular basis and I believe it sustained me through the demanding years of graduate school. 
At the time I began a yoga practice I was feeling physically and emotionally beaten down. For me, graduate school in psychology involved years of constant hard work while worrying about sinking deeper and deeper into student loan debt. It involved being trained to analyze, critique, plan, and problem-solve. It also involved being continuously evaluated to ensure I was measuring up. It created an atmosphere of competition within my very gifted peers. Thus, the process fostered in me an ability to strive hard, judge, and think, think, think…….To basically live in my head and ignore my body. 
Yoga offered an alternative. It helped balance my life while literally teaching me balance. It offered balance by encouraging me to try and quiet my mind vs always actively thinking, to focus on being in the present moment instead of constantly planning ahead, to connect to my body instead of purely caught up in my thoughts, and to let go of judgment and focus instead on accepting myself just where I was. This was a revelation. The yoga studio became my sanctuary. 
These aspects of yoga are highly consistent with the practice of mindfulness. In fact, yoga has traditionally been used not as an end in itself or for fitness, but as a means of preparing the body for meditation. 
My next encounter with mindfulness occurred during my internship year at a VA hospital. I attended a lecture given by Dr. Stephen McPherson which first directly introduced me to the concept of mindfulness. He presented it in the context of it being a new psychotherapy treatment approach to consider using with our new returning combat Veterans. This was in 2006 and still early on in Operation Enduring Freedom. The focus was on trying to prepare mental health professionals for the huge influx of new Veterans with PTSD that we were expecting. He had been involved in treating Vietnam Veterans with PTSD within the VA system for years and was devastated when we once again sent young troops off to war. When you work so closely with the human beings whose lives have been ruined by war, you begin to see political actions that involve new conflicts through a different lens. It becomes very personal. I learned this myself after going on to work in the VA system and seeing tortured soul after tortured soul. 
However, during this lecture my interest in mindfulness was peaked. Dr. McPherson made a comment something along the lines of “It is all ultimately okay”. This was how he viewed suffering through the lens of mindfulness. This phrase reverberated around in my head and surfaced repeatedly from that point on. I found it immensely comforting. For me it caused something that felt like a loosening of tension. At the time I felt things in general were the opposite of okay. I worried about how I would pay off my student debt, about graduating from my internship, about getting a job, and about being a good psychologist. 
Dr. McPherson did not mean it is all okay in a Pollyana-ish way. He did not mean everything will work out happily in the end. Instead I think he meant whatever happens, it simply is what it is. He was touching on the aspect of mindfulness that means opening to and accepting what is happening in the moment without judgment. It was a comment about the acceptance of suffering which is an inevitable part of life. This suggested to me that there was an alternate way of viewing life and suffering that was radically different from the cognitive-behavioral lens that was so popular within psychology at the time.  The emphasis within CBT is more on control than acceptance. Suffering is seen as something to overcome or change. I will say more about the differences later.
After the lecture I made a point of reading materials that would introduce me further to this thing called mindfulness. I first read the therapist’s manual for conducting an evidence-based protocol for depression entitled “Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy”. This protocol is primarily geared towards mindfulness; however also tries to weave it together with treatment that is known to work for depression from a cognitive-behavioral perspective. It was this book that opened the world of mindfulness to me. The principles of this book are now available in a more lay person friendly format entitled, “Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World” and I highly recommend it. 
Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy draws on the work of Jon Kabat-Zinn. Kabat-Zinn first introduced the concept of mindfulness into the field of Western psychology in the 1979 when he developed the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. He was referred the patients with chronic issues such as pain whose physicians felt they had offered all that they could medically, yet they were still suffering. He put these patients into an eight week training course in mindfulness meditation. Since then, the topic of mindfulness has exploded within Western psychology and has triggered much research. The research has been impressively supportive of the powerful tool that is mindfulness to actually physically change brain patterns for the better. Mindfulness has become a core component of some of the most successful treatments being used in the field today including as mentioned above, Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy, in addition to Acceptance and Commitment Therapy and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. 
Back to my own journey with mindfulness. After reading Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy, I attempted to utilize it with Veterans within a group format. I say that I “attempted” for several reasons. One was because I had no supervisors trained in mindfulness. This meant I was on my own trying to learn how to use it. When I would attempt to discuss what I was doing with my supervisors, they were mostly dumbfounded as it was so counterintuitive to the way they operated.  I think this is because they were primarily coming from a Western rationalistic perspective that emphasized control of symptoms, not acceptance of symptoms. 
This rationalist approach has dominated in the Western world and has its roots in the Enlightenment, when Descartes said “I think, therefore I am”. In the age of reason, logical thought became revered. In fact, its origins can be traced all the way back to the ancient Greeks. Plato also revered rational thought as the only path to true knowledge. This was in contrast to Aristotle who viewed observation of the environment as the only trustworthy path to knowledge. Plato was more of a philosopher, while Aristotle was more of scientist. Plato valued logic. Aristotle valued direct observation and experience.  
Plato’s rationalist perspective, carried forth by Descartes, worships rational thought. Within this framework rational thought conquers all. This viewpoint has shaped the foundations of the field of psychology, particularly shaping one of the theoretical orientations which currently dominates in the field, cognitive therapy. Within this theory, irrationality is considered to be the root of many psychological problems and the answer is to become more rational by changing the way we think. In addition, a traditional behavioral component of addressing psychiatric symptoms has been to focus on assuaging them through interventions such as relaxation training. By contrast, mindfulness emphasizes accepting whatever is occurring in the moment and simply observing it instead of trying to change it. This is a radical break from Western tradition. 
Rational thought, or logic, is a powerful and wonderful tool for accomplishing many things in society, such as advancing science and technology, building cities, and planning strategic political moves. Through its use we are able to control many aspects of life and create a more comfortable environment. Western psychology has primarily applied this same approach to tackling the world of emotion and mental well-being. In contrast, within a mindfulness based approach, entrenchment with our thoughts is viewed as sometimes being an obstacle to a wise relationship with our emotions and mental well-being. Mindfulness-based approaches agree that thoughts can contribute to emotional problems. However, whereas CT approaches indicate thoughts are also the answer to the problem, mindfulness-based therapies de-emphasize a problem solving approach to thoughts and feelings and posit that this can actually add fuel to the fire. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy uses the example of the Chinese Finger Trap to illustrate this point. Once your finger is in the trap, the more you strain and try to vigorously pull out of it, the tighter its grip becomes. Whereas within mindfulness it is considered that by allowing and observing difficult thoughts and feelings with curiosity, neither pushing them away nor fueling them, they are more likely to dissolve on their own.    
Referring back again to my attempts to develop a mindfulness based psychotherapy group, one supervisor in particular, a cognitive-behavioral therapist, was somewhat contentious towards mindfulness. He was present during the lecture given by Dr. Stephen McPherson on mindfulness mentioned above. After hearing mindfulness described for the first time, he raised his hand and stated (condescendingly), “Isn’t it just detachment”? He stated this as if detachment was obviously a bad thing and that he had summed up all of what mindfulness had to offer in one dismissive comment. On a side note, just to highlight how entrenched psychologists can be within their own theoretical camps, during a lecture given by a psychoanalytic therapist, I saw this same supervisor described above put his feet up on a chair, lean back with his arms behind his head, and close his eyes throughout the lecture. This was his way of saying, “Your therapeutic orientation is stupid”.  I dislike this “My approach is the only true way” way of thinking as it is overly simplistic and egomaniacal. 
(write about what Kornfield says about detachment).
Another reason that I stated I was merely “attempting” to implement MBCT is that I now realize that the developers of MBCT say you cannot label what you are doing MBCT unless you are an experienced meditator. Thus, you must have considerable personal experience with meditation and how it changes you to conduct a genuine MBCT group. In contrast, I was just learning about the concepts intellectually at the time and had little personal experience to draw on. In spite of my ignorance, many Veterans found the group life changing. 
Veteran’s with PTSD used what they learned about mindfulness and applied it to the intrusive memories about war with which they constantly grappled. Instead of focusing on these as being something awful they must get rid of, they tried allowing the memories to surface when they surfaced with an attitude of non-judgment. The tried to simply notice a memory had appeared without the added mental critique such as “This is awful and I can’t stand it” or without trying to analyze the memory as they often do with thoughts such as “What if I had done this or that instead” or “Was it my fault?”. Many Veterans found this revolutionary and extremely useful. One Veteran described how he used the drive to the VA hospital as an opportunity to practice being present and paying attention to what he was seeing along the way. Once he described seeing a newly birthed calf stumbling around and stated he would have normally missed something like this. His usual tendency was to spend the drive ruminating over events that occurred in Vietnam. He found this shift in perspective a great relief and helped reconnect him with the world outside his head. 
Veterans who were wheelchair bound, limited by chronic pain, and depressed began to observe the small happenings within their small world with new interest. Such as one man who used a mindfulness exercise to begin watching the daily developments of a spider’s web outside his window. He began to marvel at the complexity of it and learned to enjoy other small things. Years after one particular combat Veteran with PTSD who had attended the group, I ran into him in the VA hallway. He had a dog with him and told me that learning to be mindful had changed his life. He pointed to the dog and said interacting with his dog and observing how his dog lives life helps remind him to live in the present instead of the past.  These Veteran’s powerful responses to being introduced to mindfulness inspired me and helped me get serious about using mindfulness more in my own life when I became physically sick.  
Now let me say more about Mindfulness as it was introduce to me by MBCT. The description of mindfulness below is meant to provide a very brief introduction on the topic. If it sounds interesting to you, then I encourage you to read books that go into much great elaboration, such as “Mindfulness: An Eight-Week Plan for Finding Peace in a Frantic World” or Jon Kabat-Zinn’s book Full Catastrophe Living.  
In a nutshell, mindfulness has to do with entering into a “being” mode of existence vs a “doing” mode of existence. Doing mode is what is occurring when we are caught up in thoughts, analyzing, problem solving, or fixing things. There is a wrestling with thoughts that occurs when we are in doing mode. By contrast, being mode involves connecting to a state of pure awareness. This is a position from which we observe but are not caught up in the patterns of our mind. We are instead fully present for what is occurring in the moment. The book describes seven characteristics of doing versus being modes of mind that are: 
-	Automatic pilot vs conscious choice: Most of us tend to spend much of our time in a state of mind called automatic pilot. This means that our minds are somewhere else besides fully attending to what we are doing or thinking. We get caught up in routines and habitual ways of functioning without paying attention. A classic example provided in most texts about mindfulness is the experience we have when we zone out while driving a vehicle and realize we have no idea where we have been. Automatic pilot mode makes us more vulnerable to mindlessly repeating problematic patterns of thought or behavior without even recognizing that we are doing so. By contrast, if we are being mindful then we are paying attention to what is going on, to what we are doing. When we are attending to the moment we are more likely to notice this and then can make different choices.   
When I am on autopilot I mindless give in to a sense that I should be productive. When I act on this while on autopilot I tend to engage in actions that make me sicker, such as overdoing it. When I am paying attention I can then choose a wise way to go about accomplishing things. For example, since I have become sick, I have also become highly sensitive to heat. When on automatic pilot I tend to ignore the signs that I am becoming overheated such as while working in my garden. I am caught up in my habitual tendency to work until the job is done. By the time I come inside my face is beat red and for some reason my oscillopsia is greatly aggravated. I then collapse somewhere and can do nothing but close my eyes and feel as if I am spinning. When I am paying attention, I am tuned into the signs my body is giving me. I can then choose to come inside. 
Sometimes I tune in and notice the urge to be productive and deliberately choose to sit with it without acting on it. I just watch it arising and then watch as it dissipates when I do not act on it.  I do not always have to be productive.
-	Analyzing vs sensing: When we are in doing mode we are caught up in our thoughts and not experiencing the world directly. By contrast, when we are being mindful this means relating to the world more directly by connecting to information coming in through our senses. When being mindful we attend to what we are seeing, feeling, hearing, smelling, and tasting. When caught up in doing mode we often miss these rich experiences. An example provided in MBCT is how we wolf down our food without noticing the full sensory experience of eating. 
I particular notice this in my life when I am walking my dog around the neighborhood. I find it easier to be mindful at some times more than others. When I am being mindful, my walks can be delightful. I see the effects of the changing seasons on the trees and what is growing in my neighbor’s yards. The closer I pay attention the more I notice. For example, my neighbor has sedum growing in fall. From a distance it looks like a rust color. If you look closely you notice that the center is red and it is surrounded by yellow. These blend together to look rusty.  
I notice with amusement the varying sized dogs that come out to bark at my dog. I hear the sounds of birds chirping and the wind rustling leaves. I notice the sensation of the sun warming my face or a cool breeze brushing against my cheek. Sometimes I smell the smoke from fires being burned to warm homes in winter or barbeques being fired up in summer. The sensory experiences to be feasted upon are endless. 
However, more often than not, I have difficulty being mindful on my walks. I am for brief moments and then my mind becomes caught up in thought, analysis. Luckily, mindfulness does not teach a harsh response to this very human occurrence. Instead the mindful approach is to be aware enough to at least notice when this occurs and then non-judgmentally, return focus to the intended target, such as directly experiencing my walk.  
It is educational to take notice of where your mind has drifted and what it is up to. This is how you become acquainted with your own mental habits and gradually become less likely to be mindlessly trapped in them. This can be a humbling process. I’ve learned on my walks that I am particular vulnerable to replaying events that have occurred with an emphasis on self-justification. In other words, I like to try to prove to myself that I am right about things.  I am not proud to admit this. This seems to relate to the involvement of my own ego and also my tendency towards perfectionism.  It can be frustrating when I recognize how strong these tendencies are and how difficult it is to reign it in. Sometimes I want to yell at my mind, “knock it off!” Thank goodness mindfulness also includes learning to be kind and non-judgmental towards yourself. Because of this at times I am able to simply smile at myself and say something like, “Wow, ego, you really want to win!”.

I am an introvert and have wondered if introverts are more prone to getting caught up in their thoughts and disconnected from their direct experiences. In The Introvert’s Way, Sophia Dembling suggests that this is a problem for introverts. A study…..indicates that people are less happy when caught up in thoughts and not focused on the task at hand. Even if the thoughts are neutral. She suggests that because of this introverts need to look into becoming more mindful.
-	Striving vs accepting: When we are in doing mode, our knee jerk reaction to life experiences is to judge them as being something we like or don’t like, want or don’t want. When in doing mode we are focused on the gap between how things are and how we want them to be. By contrast, when in being mode we focus on simply noticing the way things actually are and fully accepting that reality. It involves sitting with reality as it is in the moment. Williams et al write that being mode “invites you temporarily to suspend judgment. It means briefly standing aside and watching the world as it unfolds, while allowing it to be just as it is for a moment.” By doing this we create space in our minds for creativity to emerge. We are then more likely to see more options available to us in response to what we are experiencing. 
-	Seeing thoughts as solid and real versus treating them as mental events: Mindfulness involves recognizing that thoughts are not facts and are not “us”. They are merely mental events. Sometimes they are helpful and sometimes they are not. They cannot always be trusted. We are often too quick to believe our thoughts without question. When being mindful, we take a step back from our thoughts and watch them instead of being caught up in them. We learn to watch them with a sense of distance. This is especially helpful when our thoughts are destructive. For example, depressed people tend to ruminate on negative and self-critical thoughts, such as “I’m such a loser” or “It’s all my fault” or “Things are hopeless”. If the buy these thoughts and chew on them, this worsens their depression. Anxious people tend to worry which involves being caught up in thoughts about what might happen in the future. Or they get caught up in “should” thoughts, such as “I should be perfect”. These exacerbate anxiety. Paranoid people tend to get caught up in thoughts about how others are trying to harm them or how wronged they have been. When we are being mindful we can notice these thoughts as they arise in the mind and choose not to buy or engage with them. We can label them as merely “thoughts” and let them go. 
This has been particularly helpful for me when it comes to the catastrophizing thoughts that can go along with illness. When symptoms arise that are not understood it is tempting to jump to conclusions about worst case scenario interpretations of what they mean, such as “What if things just get worse?” or “What if I’m dying?”. When one is swept along with this panic can quickly ensue. However, since practicing mindfulness, I have become quick to identify these thoughts, label them as “catastrophizing”, which zaps them of their power, and then let them drift out of my mind.  
Before mindfulness became popular within psychology, cognitive therapy had highlighted that our thoughts can be misleading. However, within cognitive therapy we are taught to engage with our thoughts by challenging them with more rational thoughts. Instead with mindfulness, we simply disengage from the thoughts by observing and labeling them as merely thoughts and this disempowers them.  
-	Avoidance vs approaching- Another aspect of doing mode involves trying to get away from the things we don’t want. This can be useful in protecting us from truly dangerous things. However, it becomes problematic when we extend this approach to our inner experiences such as that of feelings, thoughts, or sensations. This is because within such areas, areas in which we actually have little control, the more we try to get away, often the stronger they become. For example, when we try deliberately to not think about something, this gives the thought more steam. When we try to avoid feeling an emotion, it builds, sometimes expressing itself in troublesome ways such as worsening physical symptoms. When we try to push physical discomfort out of awareness this can make is seem even more frightening and intolerable.  By contrast, when in being mode, we lean into the discomfort, looking at it, opening to it, even being curious about it. This is done with a little distance so as not get lost in it or unnecessarily feed it. A wonderful way of exploring this is to practice the Body Scan meditation which is used both in MBCT and MBSR programs. Within this meditation, the individual slowly allows the focus of their attention to move from one part of the body to the next with a sense of open curiosity. These means that if there are areas of pain or discomfort, the attention settles there and looks at this. This is radically different than cognitive behavioral approaches to pain which tend to involve using distraction techniques to aim attention elsewhere.
When I have practiced the body scan and have encountered areas of discomfort, I have found that sometimes they momentarily feel a little bit worse, but if I keep my attention there with a sense of openness, allowing the sensations to be there, then typically they begin to seem less significant, even at times dissolving almost entirely. When conducting the body scan exercise with patients, some with chronic pain are so use to trying to be disconnected from their bodies and so frightened of their pain, that they initially have a strong negative, almost panicked response to the exercise. Some choose to put up a wall at this point and no longer participate in such exercises. I wonder if they had stuck with it, if this reaction would eventually soften. 
This is what I experienced with meditations on mindful breathing. Mindful breathing differs significantly from the deep breathing exercises taught in relaxation training. With minful breathing, one watches and feels one’s breathing without trying to control it in any way. I initially found this not only difficult, but anxiety provoking. This is because as soon as I shifted the focus of my attention to my breathing, it felt like the process switched from involuntary to voluntary and I could not seem to relinquish control. The more I tried not to control it, the stronger and deeper my breathing became. Eventually, I began to experience the sensation of shortness of breath and sometimes felt I needed to gasp for breath. I did not start this way, but ended up this way when I would meditate on my breathing. Focusing on my breathing became a highly unpleasant experience. I actually began avoiding breathing meditations for awhile. Then eventually, I returned to them and over time as I stuck with it, these experience softened and I became more and more able to step back and watch the breathing. If I did begin breathing too effortfully, I learned to not overreact to this and just let it be. Then this would pass more easily. Something else that helped was reading Jon Kabat Zinn’s description of doing mindful breathing as if you are approaching you breath similar to how you would gently sneak up on a resting animal. This helped me not sort of attack my breath with intent focus, but instead to become aware of it sort of casually and not intently, then gradually become more and more focused on it. 
Early on when I was first learning about mindfulness, I tried using a breathing meditation with a close friend who had severe anxiety. She likely suffered from generalized anxiety disorder. This condition involves fcontinuous worry. When her worry was particular out of control once, we tried the exercise. When the focus of her attention switched from the more detached perspective of mental worry to direfdt encounter with her physical sensations of anxiety,  She then had a panic attack.    
This applies to thoughts and emotions as well. When I get caught up in troublesome thoughts and then catch myself doing so, sometimes I take a look at what my mind was up to with a sense of open curiosity and then at times have a good laugh over the ridiculousness of what I am thinking about. When I do this with painful emotions, they too often tend to lose steam. You can experiment with the different approaches of trying to avoid versus approach thoughts, feelings, and sensations and see for yourself. However, if you are dealing with emotions related to a history of trauma, it is best to explore these areas with a mental health professional guiding you through the process.  
It is amazing how powerful our minds can be when it comes to producing unpleasant thoughts when we are trying to meditate. For some people these may be anxious thoughts or depressive ruminative thoughts. For me I tend to get stuck on thoughts when I am angry about something. Anger is like fuel that gets thrown on anger thoughts, igniting them and feeding them. Anger is a powerful emotion and and the thoughts that accompany it are difficult to ignore. I recall from leading an anger management group based on ACT, that when we are angry we tend to ruminate on what made us angry, on who wronged us and how. We replay they events and have arguments in our heads and all this serves amplify the anger. Its gets bigger and bigger. Thus, mindfulness can help us to notice when this is happening and begin to work with observing and not engaging with these thoughts. However, as I have stated before, I find this most difficult. The other type of thought that gets me hooked in as when my mind is in problem-solving mode. I have something I want to sort out. Usually I want to find an answer and be right. 
-	Mental time travel vs present moment fully engaged with the present moment. I have actually found it easier to be present when at my sickest. When I am exhausted all I can do is observe the present moment. I become too fatigued to think about the past or the future. When I feel better and have more energy, my mind whirls into action munching, crunching, chomping on thoughts, problems, and generating ideas. I feel compelled to switch into doing mode. But it is comforting to know that such serenity can be found in difficult times.  


-	Depleting vs nourishing activities
Observer self = pure awareness = being mode, mbct

ACT – Hexaflex – psychological flexibility
-	Contacting the present moment (be here now)
-	Defusion (watch your thinking)
-	Acceptance (open up)
-	Self as context (pure awareness)
-	Values (know what matters)
-	Commited action (do what it takes)

Kelly Wilson – psychological flexibility lecture
Stories we tell ACT – say my life is ruined, I caused this, This new symptom is going to kill me, they’re missing something….we fuse with them. Use don’t know mind.
The Buddhist writer Pema Chodron write about how much turmoil we create and peace we forgo when we focus on what we want to be different instead of appreciating what we already have. 
There is often resistance when people are first presented with the concept of acceptance. This is because it may initially sound as if what is being recommended is passivity. I have experienced this resistance when discussing the acceptance part of mindfulness with individuals who have experienced trauma such as sexual assault. When acceptance is mentioned, they interpret this to mean that they must say that what happened to them is okay. Or some interpret it to mean that if you are in a bad situation, like an abusive marriage, you should just accept this and stay. This is not at all what is meant by acceptance. Instead, acceptance refers to a full acknowledgement of reality. It is about saying, “this is the reality of things” without turning away from that truth or trying to pretend things are something other than what they are. Jon Kabat-Zinn writes that in contrast to passive resignation, acceptance is about a willingness to see things as they actually are. This then “sets the stage” for taking wise action. To make effective changes in our life, we must first be willing to fully recognize the reality of what is.
Kabat-Zinn defines healing as “coming to terms with things as they are”. Combat Veterans sometimes get caught up in thoughts that involve replaying events that happened while deployed, particularly when friends lost their lives. They ruminate on “what if” thoughts and “I should have” thoughts and “if only” thoughts about what occurred. Of course there is no end point or resolution to such lines of thinking, only torment. Underneath these thoughts are often strong feelings of survivor guilt and sadness. These patterns of thought can be considered a form of resisting true acceptance of what happened. They are a form of avoidance of fully feeling their sadness and sitting with it. This prevents them from grieving and healing and keeps them stuck.  
In the context of trauma or abuse, to begin to heal one must first start with full acknowledgement that this event happened and there is no running away from that. This radical acceptance in contrast to denial creates the right frame of mind to then begin to move forward with one’s life. When acceptance occurs this involves allowing all the painful emotions associated with what happened to be fully felt and not avoided. Then one can begin to heal.
In the context of chronic illness, such as chronic pain, acceptance is key. When I have worked with patients who experience chronic pain I have noticed a difference in that some focus on the pain, its presence dominates their life. For others, this is not so. I have asked those who do not seem consumed with the pain how they got to that point and they invariably say that they had to come to a place where they accepted that the pain is there instead of struggling against it. Those who are focused on the pain are caught up in thoughts such as “This isn’t fair” or “I’m too young to feel this way” or on how their physician won’t give them enough painkillers. 
For myself, I have noticed that when I have moments where I fully acknowledge that my symptoms are present, my body is sick, and let go of struggling against this in the various ways that I do, I feel at peace. When I instead get caught up trying to figure out why I am sick, or thoughts about how I should not be sick, or actions that involve ignoring that I am sick, then I suffer.  
Ah, sweet acceptance
I try to practice acceptance whenever I notice myself struggling with unpleasant internal experiences. For example, one day I was walking my dog and strong feelings of hunger set in. I should have eaten before we left; however didn’t. When I get hungry, it hits suddenly and intensely. I become irritable and have difficulty thinking clearly. My husband calls it “nutsy” because he thinks I act “nuts” when I am hungry. So, to gauge when we need to eat my husband will ask if I am feeling “nutsy”.  So, this kicked in while I was with the dog and a considerable way from home. My initially reaction was, “Damn it, I should have eaten first!” followed by “This is awful” and “I wish I was closer to home”. I became so focused on being home so I could relieve the hunger that I made it all worse. So I tried instead practicing acceptance. I first noted what I was feeling objectively, “Gnawing in my stomach” and “jittery” and “light headed”. Then I just opened to these sensation as they were without the added storyline relating to how much I disliked it and wanted to fix it. I embraced a sense that this is just how it is right now. Then there was an easing of my distress and even to some degree of the unpleasant sensations. I realized I did not have to get away from them. They could be there and that was okay.

Mindfulness has helped me tune into my body more and to notice when I am doing things that are exacerbating my problems. For example, in addition to the symptoms of fatigue and oscillopsia that are recent developments, I have been susceptible to both tension and migraine headaches since my early 20s. Sometimes I have no control over the headaches developing, such as when I wake up with a migraine. However, there are environmental factors that can trigger them. One in particular is light. Unfortantely for me I love sunlight. I love to lay by a window and read while the sun streams in. However, I have to be careful because before too long, I will notice tension beginning to form. Then I can choose to ignore this and bask in the warm glow, or get up and move. I spend much time and effort avoiding glare. If you were around me, you would notice I often have one eye closed or I am sitting strategically where there are no bright lights coming from one side. This will trigger a migraine. Being mindful helps me notice these situations and adjust to avoid unnecessary suffering. However, there are also times when I get so sick of having to make so many adjustments and start to get caught up in “Why is my body so finicky” and “It’s not fair, other people don’t have to worry about this stuff” and “I just want to sit here with these lights on damn it!” Then I use another aspect of mindfulness, I observe how my judgmental thoughts are not helping and let them go. I try to focus on just accepting that this is the way things are and making my adjustments without complaint. This works well.

Mindfulness has helped me become aware far more often when I am caught up in my thoughts, so that I have the opportunity to exit the conversation. Before learning about mindfulness and tuning in to what my mind is up to from a meta level, I spent more time than I would like to admit vehemently immersed in some line of thinking. Now I catch myself doing this and have the choice to continue or not. I especially find this helpful when my inner chatter is most active, when I am trying to go to selep. It is such a wonderful feeling when you catch yourself doing this and have the opportunity to switch into a simple awareness mode. I feel my brain loosening, like letting go of something clenched in your fist. Tension oozes away and more often than not, I am surprised to notice how vehemently I was thinking about something totally uninteresting and a waste of time.

One way I like to meditate is lying in my guestroom bed with the window open, listening to the sounds of the neighborhood. It is a bright, sunny room. I lay right by the window where the sun streams in and close my eyes and listen. When I do this, a whole world opens up. I notice birds chirping, leaves rustling,  lawn mowers humming, and the distant soft roar of cars. I find it much more difficult to maintain my attention on hearing than when I focus on my breath, so I don’t use listening to sounds as my primary, regular meditation practice. But I certainly enjoy the times when I do this.

Chapter Six
The Symptoms
Neurological symptoms are freaky. They have a tremendous way of making you feel out of control. The ones I have experienced involve things you take for granted as basic reliable functions such as vision, steadiness, the energy you need to get through your day, and the ability to think clearly. 
Oscillopsia:
Waking up one day and realizing that the trees outside your window appear to be jiggling and no matter how hard you try to hold your eyes still and focus, you cannot, is a terrifying experience. I eventually learned that this symptom is called oscillopsia and has a neurological basis. It seemed to come on suddenly and intensely early into my illness. Prior to that morning I just described, the disturbing sensations I had seemed more like vague dizziness. But after the experience was so distinct that morning, I tried to pay attention to exactly what it was that I was experiencing that I had previously described as “dizziness” or “movement in my head”. I noticed that the feeling of movement related to the sensation that my eyes were constantly jiggling. I noticed it most when I tried to read, focus my eyes on something outside my windows, or closed my eyes. When my eyes are closed there is a distinct sensation that my eyes just will not be still and are jumping around in my eye sockets. This is unnerving when trying to fall asleep. 
Over time I have learned to adapt to the problem. When my eyes are open, if I keep them deliberately moving around, scanning instead of focusing on one thing, I don’t notice it so much and I can enjoy sight. However, if I do try to focus on one thing, then inevitably things appear to be jumping around. This is unpleasant. When watching birds in my backyard, instead of looking steadily at one, I look, then scan around, then come back to it briefly. This works. When reading, I’ve noticed that if I keep my eyes moving quickly over the words, my brain takes in the meaning and I don’t notice the jumping so much. If I try to focus on one word, the jumping becomes so noticeable it distracts me. As you can imagine this is tiring, so I frequently have to close my eyes and rest from all this stimulation. When I am tired and as the day progresses, this symptom worsens. Thus, I can only reading during the first half of the day.  
There are times that by evening the oscillopsia is so intense I also become dizzy. That is, it feels like things are spinning/swimming in my head. When I was still working, it was like this every evening. Now, it only gets this bad if I really overdo it. When it gets like this, I cannot function at all. I have to lay down. Initially when this would occur, I would brace against it, try to resist it somehow. I would have waves of fear wash over me as I spun. I would also have catastrophic thoughts such as “Oh, God, no!” Words like “awful”, “unbearable”, “terrible”, “terrifying”, “forever”, and “permanent” would enter my mind. Of course this only served to grab ahold of my fear and launch into new levels of torture. 
Eventually I learned to practice skills I had learned as a psychologist. Particularly, I thought about how the practice of mindfulness involves observing the moment without judgment. I thought of a research study done within the field of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy which found that when the experience of hyperventilation was induced in women, those who used an acceptance instead of control approach to what they were feeling found it less distressing. So, I tried to deliberately watch what was happening, and describe it in factual terms as much as I could, without adding the layers of analysis. I also tried to stay totally in the moment, not worrying about how long it would last. I simply thought, “movement”, “spinning”. Nothing more. Then I used acceptance. I tried to open to the sensations as if they were welcome. I thought “This is just what is happening right now” and “It’s all okay”. As I softened my attitude towards the experience, the symptoms also somewhat softened. Doing this, I gradually developed a different, less tense relationship with my symptoms. I began to stop struggling with them and using an ACT metaphor, “Put down the shovel”.
This reminds me of a concept discussed in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy called Dirty vs Clean suffering. Clean suffering is the unavoidable discomfort that occurs in life such as negative physical or emotional reactions to events that occur. For example, if we are suddenly cut off by another driver we might feel a surge of adrenaline and feel momentarily panicked or enraged. That is clean suffering. It is just what happens. But if we add to it negative thoughts such as “What an asshole! What was he thinking! He did that on purpose!” or “Great, this is going to be a terrible day.” Or “Everything happens to me” we will exacerbate the suffering and add an unnecessary layer called dirty suffering. It is called dirty because it is unnecessary and makes things worse. 
This idea shows up in all the mindfulness based therapies that have developed recently within the field of psychology, such as Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy. I have also found it discussed by Buddhist writers such as Pema Chodron. In “Living Beautifully” Pema writes discusses our universal discomfort with the fundamental ambiguity of being human. That is, that as humans we tend to cling and grasp for certainty and security. This creates a problem because life involves constant change including inevitably, our ultimate demise. She calls this the “groundlessness” of existence. She states that we suffer not so much because of this reality, but because of our avoidance of accepting it.  She states that if we could embrace it, we could experience liberation, freedom. But instead we cling to wanting things to be a certain way. We cling to what we like and want and try to escape what we don’t. She states that we try to resist in various ways such as through collecting material possessions to feel secure, developing addictions to cling to pleasure and avoid discomfort, or grasping on to a particular ideology or belief system in a dogmatic way in order to avoid dealing with uncertainty.  We want to wrap ourselves up in a snuggly blanket of certainty, telling ourselves that our way is the right way. We dismiss others who are different and who may challenge our dearly held beliefs. 
Another way that we avoid accepting the fundamental ambiguity of being human as that when we have uncomfortable physical sensations or emotions arise we “Rev up our thoughts about it. What if this happens? What if that happens? We stir up a lot of mental activity. Body, speech, and mind become engaged in running away from the feeling, which only keeps it going and going and going.” Pema discusses Jill Bolte Taylor, a neuroscientist who wrote about her own experiences of recovering from a massive stroke in the book “My Stroke of Insight”. Jill writes about how emotions are triggered automatically and if left to run their course will fade after 90 seconds. However, because of how we respond, typically to make judgments about it and engage in much mental chatter, we throw fuel onto the fire and the emotion continues or even strengthens. 
Pema recommends the following exercise to use when a difficult feeling arises: 
“Acknowledge the feeling, give it your full, compassionate, even welcoming attention, and even if it’s only for a few seconds, drop the story line about the feeling. This allows you to have a direct experience of it, free of interpretation. Don’t fuel it with concepts or opinions about whether it’s good or bad. Just be present with the sensation. Where is it located in your body? Does it remain the same for very long? Does it shift and change?” 
By not adding a layer of judgment or interpretation to the meaning of my unpleasant physical symptoms, I have minimized the amount of distress associated with them and by opening to them eventually I have even befriended them.
So as to not misrepresent myself as some kind of mindfulness practicing superhero, I must admit there are times when the symptoms are so bad for so long that I give in and take an Ativan. Ativan is a benzodiazepine and typically used for anxiety. However, it is also used for neurological symptoms such as seizures. It calms neuronal over-excitement in the brain including the vestibular system which controls the sensation so dizziness. Benzodiazepines are highly addictive. Thus, I use them as little as possible. However, there are times when I feel so run down with coping that I give in and gain relief. 
There is a drastic difference in approach to working with such experiences as my dizziness within the field of psychology.  I have described how an ACT perspective might be used above. Within the world of ACT, it is thought that trying to maintain control over things that we truly cannot control like thoughts, sensations and emotions is a problem. Instead, accepting and allowing them to be present while also not feeding them is a better approach.  It is thought that wrestling with or avoiding such experiences makes them more powerful. 
Whereas a more traditional Western psychological approach is that of cognitive-behavioral therapy. Within this approach aiming for control is emphasized. This is done through actively challenging thoughts. It is also done by handling distressing experiences through techniques such as relaxation and distraction. If I were using a CBT approach to handling the above situation, I might try to distract myself from the dizziness by thinking about something else. I might try to subtly control what is occurring by trying to relax in the midst of it. I could do this by imaging a calming scene or saying comforting things to myself like “I can handle this” or “it will pass”. As an experiment with a sample size (N) of one, I tried using these techniques as well. When the symptoms are not bad, then getting focused on something else, distraction, can be useful. It takes my mind off the symptoms. However, this is a very temporary solution and contributes subtly to a strained relationship with the symptoms that is then heightened when they flare up. I found all of the CBT techniques basically useless when the symptoms became strong. I found it much more helpful to give the symptoms my attention in a non-judgmental, curious, and open way and allow them to be present until they passed. In other words, trying to control the symptoms or get rid of the distress associated with them did not work well and instead seemed to heighten them. 
The difference in these two approaches applies to any emotional or physical experience including anxiety, sadness, or anger. One can try to control it, master it, or escape it. Or one can try to make peace with what is in fact uncontrollable. This does not apply to behavior, which in the world of ACT is thought to be controllable. ACT therapists state that although emotions and thoughts are uncontrollable, they just happen; behavior is a choice. Thus, one might feel angry; however choose not to behave aggressively. One might feel anxious and still choose to face one’s fears. When it comes to physical symptoms such as dizziness, there are times that I can choose to tolerate them in order to spend some time with friends. However, typically the better choice for me is to honor my body and be still. I’m in control of this behavior and the best choice is inactivity. The ACT bottom line is do what works. When angry, lashing out does not work well. When anxious, hiding from the world does not work well. When chronically ill, pushing yourself when you should be resting does not work well either.
To those of you who are not trained in or interested in psychology, the differences between ACT and CBT may seem irrelevant or insignificantz. But let me say that within the world of psychology, the differences between the two camps is major. The different views on the issue of control are key. The ACT and other mindfulness based approaches have been earth-shattering to the field of psychology. I was trained more in a CBT approach and when I tried to learn ACT and implement it felt like I had entered opposite land and everything felt counter-intuitive.

Sick and tired – catastrophizing
Reading books about chronic illness, about symptoms common to others helped normalize the symptoms, particularly brain fog, so that I didn’t not react so intensely to it.  Similar to how tx can help those with PTSD begin to normalize their symptoms, such as hypervigilance, so they don’t freak out when it happens. 
Robyn’s phone call, “I’m tired of coping”
Pain:
I have had headaches since about age 21. Both migraines and tension headaches. My triggers are primarily hormonal, bright light, and any muscle strain. I have found various ways to manage them effectively over the years. However, they have recently exploded in frequency. This followed my attempt to increase my level of exercise which I did to hopefully bolster my energy and help me sleep better at night. In terms of pain, this seemed to backfire. I tried to hang in there with the pain thinking it would go away as my body adjusted to the exercise. Months went by and it did not. I was getting 4-5 migraines per week plus tension headaches on other days. Due to my fatigue I have to lay down much of the day. I like to do this propped on a couple of pillows watching tv or reading. My neck became exquisitely sensitive to this and began cramping. As the day progressed the cramps turned into a migraine. The same thing would happen when sitting up on squishy, comfy couch. I eventually had to resort to sitting up in one of our straight back dining room chairs during the day. This was a frustrating turn of events for me as one reason I was coping okay with my fatigue is that I could lie down. Now I couldn’t. But frequent migraines and overuse of migraine medication was not an option. So I had to adjust. 
I love sunshine. Laying in our sunniest room has been another factor that has helped me cope with my predicament. I had to come to accept that this was also triggering headaches and sit in my straight back chair in our darker rooms or with the shades drawn. Due to the sun moving throughout the day, I also had to keep moving locations. All this made me even more exhausted than usual. 
I love gardening. Particularly in spring when things warm and one gets the urge to burst forth from one’s winter den. This also coincided with my new increase in headache pain. So I had to cut way back on what I had been doing in the yard. This meant taking a long break from it right at the time it was most needed, as the weeds were burgeoning. Then I was able to creep back into it by limiting myself to only filling one small bucket with weeds and calling it a day. This was yet another adjustment, and another loss. 
I tried to tackle the problem in other ways also by seeing doctors, a physical therapist, and an acupuncturist. All this fatigued me even more. One night I woke with such excruciating migraine pain that I had to go to the ER at 3am. The drugs they gave me made me feel loopy in an unpleasant way and I couldn’t wait to get out of there and home to my own bed. 
I have a history of grappling with insomnia. I had been managing it fine for some time; however in the midst of grappling with my new headache worsening, I also began having a dramatic bout of insomnia. So, right when I was feeling like the pain was just too much to deal with on top of the fatigue and visual problems, I stopped falling asleep. Are all these things connected? Probably. But my point is that it really felt like too much. One day after a night of insomnia and waking to a headache, sadness began to brew. I felt so discouraged and overwhelmed with the complexity of my problems. I was tired from my illness, tired from insomnia, and tired of being in pain. 
I had been reading Tara Brach’s “Radical Acceptance” and decided this was a good time to practice what she calls “the pause”. This is when one stops fighting and simply sits still with whatever one’s experience is in the moment. This meant tuning in to everything I was feeling right then and trying to open to it, to embrace it and let it be there with an attitude of compassion. Just as the Buddha had done under the Bodhi tree. So, I sat and I tuned in to my internal experiences. This meant noticing the ache of fatigue, the tightness of my morning headache, and more deeply, a sad heaviness in my heart. I then turned to all this with a sense of compassion towards myself. As I allowed myself to welcome the sadness I felt in a nurturing embrace, a knot began to form in my throat. Tears began to form in my eyes. I chose to stay with all this and simply let it happen without reservation. As I continued to stay with it, I began to sob. Sadness flowed out of me as my tears ran down my cheeks.  
I chose to welcome these tears and let them come freely. No holding back. This is not entirely familiar territory for me. As I tend to be an analytical person that’s default mode is to live in my head, tears are a rare experience for me. Things have to be pretty bad before tears bubble up. And yet I know from my psychological training, that suppression of emotion is unhealthy. In my therapy practice I have encountered so many individuals, often males, who are terrified of crying. There is a fear that if one let’s go by allowed the tears to come that they will never stop and one will somehow lose their sanity and fall apart permanantly. This particularly comes up in cognitive processing therapy, a treatment for Post-traumatic Stress Disorder, where the individual must allow themselves to revisit their trauma while getting in touch with the emotions that accompany it without suppressing them. When I was trained in this treatment the trainer said to reassure people that their tears will come to an end when the time is right. The treatment involves using the metaphor of a soda bottle. When you shake it up and then open to cap there is an explosion of soda. However, since the pressure was released, it eventually settles down. Just in that way, their tears will subside and by going through this process instead of avoiding it, healing can begin to occur. When I have conveyed this, I have met with a horrified look from many rugged combat Veterans who shake their heads and basically respond with a “hell no”. 
So, whenever I feel moved to cry I try to embrace it and not run. On the particular day I have been describing above as the tears flowed I had moments of remembering all those Veterans who had resisted experiencing this for themselves and I remembered their fear of letting go. I felt a connection to them as I cried. As I knew it would, my tears eventually subsided. As is typical when I have had a good cry, I then felt a little bit more at peace and more hopeful that I could in fact cope with all I was facing. Getting there required an opening to the reality of it without hiding, denying, or trying to fix it. To gain the courage to keep moving forward I had to sit down and stare at it all squarely in the face, without hesitation. I take to take a break from problem solving about how to manage or avoid it all and fully feel the reality of my predicament. Many people have difficulty with the concept of acceptance and our culture certainly does not teach it. I recall working with a cancer patient who could only consider that he would overcome the cancer and seemed to, in a nearly desperate sense, always maintain a positive attitude about the future.  He would not even broach the subject of death. Of course there is merit in being positive; however I worried about how he would cope if he was not able to win the battle.
Purpose: There are days when the combination of symptoms I am having, particularly uncontrolled migraine pain on top of fatigue seems so overwhelming and bleak that my usual coping strategies don’t seem to work and I feel I cannot accept my experience as it is. On those days I have found it helps me to think about something that feels a little deeper, my purpose for continuing to go on in spite of my circumstances. When I occasionally have the thought “I can’t face it anymore” I think about my husband and my parents. For people with children, I imagine it would be there children they would think of. When I consider what it would do to those three individuals who love me most in the world, I am compelled to acknowledge that there is backing out of this life with all its challenges. When I think of the pain it would cause them if I died, I am bolstered by courage to go on. I do love them more than I loathe this pain. Of course if I were facing terminal cancer or something more horrific than my chronic, nuisance symptoms, I may feel differently. There might come a time when I am no longer willing to fight and that would be okay. But given my particular situation, plowing on is the only reasonable option in my mind.             
One morning I woke with headache pain, got up, and took my dog for a walk. Sometimes gentle movement such as walking seems to shake the pain loose.  When I am outside, I wear a mask due to my uncontrolled seasonal allergies. Because the masks are so effective in managing my allergies, I have come to let go of the self-consciousness I feel when others see me and typically seem to gawk at me. I once had a little girl say to her mother, “Mommy, why does that weird lady have that thing on her face?” I now typically say to myself, “Whatever, it is worth it”. I also have to wear a large sun hat because I have a history of facial skin cancer. I once had a coworker who saw me wearing it in say to me, “You sure must be comfortable with yourself if you are willing to wear that”. I replied, “I have a history of skin cancer, it is not really a choice.” He looked a little sheepish.  So, on the day I mentioned above, I was walking outside with my mask and giant hat on, and had the thought “As if my allergies and sun sensitivity are not enough, now I am in pain also”. I began to feel sorry for myself for having chronic migraines. I began down the unproductive road of thinking about how unfair it is that so many others go through life without ever knowing the nuisance of chronic pain. While this is an understandable thought, it is not helpful at all. Then a passage I had just read in Tara Brach’s “Radical Acceptance” came to mind. She discussed how when the Buddha was being harassed by Mara (suffering), instead of trying to drive Mara away he invited Mara in for tea. To the Western mind more trained in striving for control than acceptance of difficulty, this is a strange and jarring idea. However, as I tried to imagine myself inviting my headache pain for a cup of tea, I did experience a shift in perspective. The pain did not lessen in that moment; however the sense of emotional suffering I felt associated with it did ease. Once again the practice of acceptance revolutionized my relationship with my problems for the better. What a sense of liberation to realize that even in the face of uncontrollable difficult circumstances, one can shift perspectives and experience a decrease in suffering. 
This technique has helped me whenever I am facing mild to moderate pain. I have not yet been able to  get to the point where I feel as if I can invite severe migraine pain in for tea. Instead I feel like inviting it for a cup of cyanide. Maybe one day I will get there. But in the meantime, in those moments, modern medicine is my friend.  
Scholar.google – articles show acceptance better than control/coping for pain.

However, I must say that while acceptance worked for me with the symptoms I have previously described, when I developed a particularly long and intense bout of tension and migraine headaches, I found I needed to take a different approach. I began experiencing daily pain in my back and neck that by evening would turn into a migraine headache. As my experience with pain has been sporadic not constant in the past, drugs have worked well. I have taken Ibuprofen for tension headaches and a triptan for migraines. This has always worked famously. However, when the pain became daily this approach no longer worked because these medications are not meant for daily use. They can lead to rebound headaches as your body becomes dependent on them. Plus these medications can harm your body with excessive use. One night I woke at 3am with the worst migraine I have ever had. I took my medication and it had not effect at all. I eventually woke my husband and he drove me to the Emergency Room. They gave me some heavy duty pain killers that made me confused and my speech slurred. I so hated the way they made me feel that I made the stop the I.V. and I went home. Eventually the headache left the following afternoon. With the kind of pain that comes with a migraine headache, I have personally not found acceptance to be much help. I think others may be better than me at achieving a state of acceptance, but when I encounter this kind of pain all I can think about is making it stop. When I think of allowing it to be there and accepting that untreated migraine pain will be part of my life I honestly think that I would rather die. This may sound morbid, but if you have experienced migraine headache pain I’ll bet there is a good chance such thoughts have crossed you mind at times. Luckily, there are many different things you can do to address different types of pain including migraine pain. I found that the best approach for me at that juncture was to get very proactive about figuring out what those things were. In other words striving for change, not acceptance became my focus. I studied my patterns and learned my triggers and did my utmost to eliminate these from my life. Now, I had some ideas about my triggers before, however I only half-heartedly avoided them because I knew medicastion would save me. However, I could not longer rely on medicastion. So, I got very self-disciplined. For me this involved no longer laying down during the day and reading or watching television, despite how exhausted I felt. I had to sit upright in a straight backed chair. If I lay down with my neck at any type of angle on pillows, it triggers cramps in my neck that lead to migraines. Light is another trigger. So I had to sit in my straight back chair in a dim room with the shades drawn, all day. Additionally, it was early spring when this occurred and right at the time when I needed to get out in my yard to begin clearing away dead growth from the previous year, weeding, and mowing. I love these activities and the spring weather. Prior to getting sick, I would spend all day, each day on the weekends working in my yard. I loved the tired, well-earned feeling it gave me at the end of the day, and the sense of accomplishment I felt when I looked at the improvements I had made. Due to my fatigue and shaky cam view of the world, I had to slow down to just doing maybe an hour of this work in a day, including some days when I could do none. But this was still something. When I came to face my pain issues, I had to admit that activities such as weeding caused back, shoulder, and neck pain that was triggering migraines. I had already figured out that I could only mow for short periods and only in the cool of the day because otherwise I would get redfaced and overheated and this would trigger a migraine. However, I observed that even when I mowed in this limited way I was still getting overheated enough that I was getting migraines. I think this is what triggered the migraine from hell described above. Additionally, since getting sick I had reduced my exercise down to merely walking the dog. Some days I could not do even that. However, I began gaining weight. Shocking, I know. I also know that exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health and wondered if I could improve my situation by getting more of it. I began riding a stationary bike in addition to walking the dog. I tried to build up very cautiously and slowly on this because I know people with conditions such as chronic fatigue syndrome can make themselves sicker with exercise.  Over several months, I built up to 30 minutes on the bike with my heart rate up and felt okay. Overall I felt more fatigued, not more energized. But I stopped gaining weight. However, I unwisely decided I was being too cautious and upped my routine to 45 minutes all at once.   So, I was now looking at living a life without my favorite activities, sitting in the dark in an upright chair. Depressing, huh? I did begin feeling sorry for myself because I felt I had already been through enough adjustment and loss with my other health issues. This felt like too much. However, I was so motivated to avoid further pain that I diligently made these changes and noticed a dramatic reduction in pain. I also began doing physical therapy for my scoliosis and acupuncture.       
Chapter Seven
Letting Go Of Work
I kept working throughout the first year and a half that I was sick. During the first six months, I had dizziness, oscillopsia, numbness and tingling in my legs, and the sensation that I would collapse when standing. I did not yet have the debilitating fatigue. I tended to sway if I tried to stand still. The problems tended to worsen as the day went on, so I was okay in the mornings. Then when the symptoms picked up around midday, I would struggle to remain at work. I often had to close my eyes to rest from the stress of my jiggling visual world. I would lean on something when waiting for the elevator, on the elevator, and when talking to a colleague. Others did not notice this was going on. The only person I told was my supervisor. I wanted to have everything out in the open in case I deteriorated to the point where it began to effect the quality of my work.  
This period of time was horrendous for me. It was awful being anywhere but in bed when feeling this way. However, it was also taxing to attempt to put on my professional hat and behave like a professional when I felt so weak and vulnerable. It was unnerving trying to consult with other professionals worrying about falling down. It was exhausting trying to interview a patient, gather highly complex information, and sensitively manage their intense emotional reactions, while simultaneously having trouble focusing my eyes on them and the notes I was taking. Overall, the quality of my work was maintained; however I think my body paid a price that may have interfered with its ability to recover.   
I often left early when it became too much and because of this I used my sick and vacation days up completely within the first six months of being sick.  Around the time I used up all my leave, I also began experiencing fatigue and slowed cognitive processing that made it even harder to function, even impossible at times. This is the point when my supervisor suggested I apply for FMLA, which I did. FMLA was granted and provided three months unpaid time I could use to take off from work without being fired. My supervisor encouraged me to try to work as much as I could instead of taking the entire 3 months off at once. He said this would create less strain on the department. I am an extremely conscientious and responsible person. I could not stand the thought of putting out my colleagues and Veterans. I was also worried about the future. Since I did not yet have a diagnosis that seemed to fit nor was I getting better, I was afraid to use all the leave up at once and then still be sick and without answers. So to try and drag out the FMLA time until things became more clear, I worked out a part-time schedule with my clinic. I dragged myself into work daily until noon. This worked okay since mornings were my best time. I then went home. Most days I would try to take a walk or do some yoga, meditate, and read books on coping with chronic illness in bed. However, on some days I could only make it from the car to the bed and stayed there.   
This schedule worked pretty well and I even started to feel as if I could do more. I felt ecstatic with joy. This occurred around November and so I increased my work hours. This coincided with the Thanksgiving holiday. Up until the holidays, I had been avoiding friends and family due to feeling lousy and trying to preserve energy for work. However, since I was now feeling a bit better, I participated (with what I thought was moderation), in family events. While all giving thanks around the table I recall be thankful for Vitamin-B12 which I thought had nearly cured me at this point. Everyone rejoiced with me. 
However, my in-laws are a large family and when they get together for the holidays, something is planned daily for about a week. They are all highly extraverted with the exception of my husband and I. For us, even when I am well, these family holidays feel like and epic journey. However, since I was ill, I went to some, but not all events, and tried to limit my time there. However, I recall a moment on Thanksgiving day when I realized I had gone past the point I should leave. We tried to stay later on that day because there was so much planned and our presence was strongly desired. We actually tried to leave at one point and were told, “No, you can’t leave yet!” I recall a point when I began to feel I had run into a wall. My body began to feel simultaneously wired and exhausted. I began to have difficulty standing and communicating. Everything started to become dream-like. I recall trying to participate in conversations but my comments lagged behind the topic. 
When we finally did go home, I knew I had crossed a line and I would pay. I just didn’t realize I would pay so greatly. When I returned to work I realized I was back nearly to where I had been before I had improved with the part time schedule. I struggled through a week or two and then told my clinic I would have to go back down to part time. 
I continued at part-time for about 4 months and again things began to improve. Again, I felt ecstatic with joy and hope. This time I attributed my recovery in part to resting, in part to the Mayo neurologist’s prediction that I would get better, and also to taking Tumeric as recommended by a friend and having a short period of normal energy following it. I thought that this time I was surely on the road to a full recovery. To celebrate (and in part because I had gained weight), I bought myself some new professional clothing. It was springtime and I was floating on cloud 9.  I wanted to believe I was healed so desperately.  
Then I told my boss to increase my hours again. Oddly, about that time my in-laws came into town for a visit. Within a couple weeks into working more and participating in some family gatherings, I fell off a cliff again. I again went back to a lesser schedule. However, this time even with the lesser schedule I did not recover. My symptoms of fatigue and slowed cognitive processing were so severe that I had to begin calling in to work and having appointments cancelled. I had worked very hard at avoiding doing this in the past. Now I had no choice because I knew I would not be able to competently do my job. 
So, my supervisor and I had another conversation.  I phoned him from home because I was too sick to go into work. I told him that I had once again declined and that I did not feel I was competent to do my job until I felt better. I had just renewed my FMLA for the next year and suggested that I use one month of it and fully rest. I stated that I understand I am asking a lot and that if he thinks it is time to consider medical retirement, I would understand. I really expected that he would say to take a month and we’ll see. Instead he stated that at this point it seems that working is hindering my recovery and he would support my application for medical retirement. This surprised me. We agreed that I would go forward with it. 
When I hung up the phone with him I went and sat on my porch swing and began to sob. I sobbed and I sobbed. My husband came out and held me. As I sobbed I felt I was releasing the tension I had carried for the previous year and a half as I tried to work as a sick person.  I also sobbed because this meant I was actually going to walk away from the career for which I had sacrificed so many years of my life. It meant walking away from my identity as a professional woman. This was a lot of loss.  
Work – Deneny “I have hypertension and that doesn’t stop me from working”.

Accepting that I was in fact sick. Maqsha linehan – willingness, acceptance – this is happening, then coping. It is a both/and. You must acknowledge the harsh reality of what is occurring fully, and then you must move forward and cope. You cannot resist realty ane struggle ginst it. This is like the digging metaphor in ACT. You must let go of the shovel but also keep going. Suffering- Holocaust – those who survived fully accepted what was occurring. Victor frankl – and found meaning in it.   
Acceptance is not a once and for all type of thing. I have found I have to continually work at actively accepting my situation. I have to conclude over and over again that I am sick and not accomplish what I once did.

Hindsight is 20/20
For much of my life, as is typical for introverts, I have had a deep yearning for knowledge, truth, and wisdom. I have been drawn to thinking, reading, and talking about things that seem most important. I was once so driven to explore spiritual questions that I left my job and attended a seminary. The field of psychology has been a good fit for me because it satisfies my urge for exploring meaningful questions. However, once I began working as a psychologist, my need for meaningful thought and connection was met during my 8 hour workday. Every day involved talking with people about the things that were most important in their life. In my free time, I had no interest or energy to do this for myself. I lost all interest in reading books or viewing films with depth. I needed to balance the heaviness of my days with some fun and fluff on my weekends and evenings. So I gravitated to lighthearted things such as cooking, decorating my home, and gardening. 
Now that I am ill and not working, space has opened up in my mind and heart and I find myself drawn back to the pursuits that interested me in psychology in the first place. I began reading about Buddhism and current psychotherapies which integrate Buddhist thinking. The space that illness has created in my life has given me the chance to engage in personal growth. 
I miss feeling useful to others. I found it such an honor to help make another feel safe enough to confide their most personal stories and to allow themselves to be vulnerable. I felt such a sense of purpose when I was able to help others feel that someone cared and was genuinely interested in what they had to say. For many combat Veterans, friends and family have conveyed to them that they do no want to hear their war stories. Yet these need to be told. Veterans expressed such appreciation when they realized I wanted to hear their story and would not turn away in horror. Although I did not show it, initially these stories were disturbing, but after time one becomes desensitized to the details of hearing about violence and horror. I did not become desensitized to the pain they felt or the reality of how these experiences were affecting their lives. I felt such compassion for every individual who shared their stories of combat and how they forever were changed. There have been moments when I felt such a sense of waste that I can no longer provide this service. However, in my readings on Buddhism I have come to see that my task at this time is to focus on extending compassion to myself. This is something I have much neglected and is as essential to Buddhist teachings as the importance of extending compassion to others. So, when I am feeling frustrated with my situation, achingly fatigued, or woozy from my oscillopsia, I try to extend compassion towards myself as I have towards others in the past. I am the one who is in need of it now. And there is meaning and purpose in that.

Chapter Eight
Adjusting to retirement plus limitations
It is strange to one day feel relevant and useful; to be immersed in the world of the productive, and then suddenly find oneself at home with no reason to leave the house. Most days that I was working as a psychologist I had a meaningful connection with another human being. I was permitted to hear the most intimate stories from their life. Then suddenly this was all gone. I spent my days in bed connecting with no one but my husband. I began to feel useless and life seemed to lose its sense of meaning. Meaningful conversations are like food to me. I think this relates to being an introvert. Introverts tend to crave deep and meaningful connection and have little interest in small talk. I came to realize that my job was filling this need.  Psychological assessment and psychotherapy involve quickly getting into the most important, meaty aspects of an individual’s life. Therapists must avoid getting deterred by small talk as it wastes time. Thus, my career was a good fit for an introvert. However, now this was gone. 
Letting go of work/urge to be productive every day – when finally gave in I found what seemed like an insatiable desire to lay in bed and watch television. This is all I wanted to do and I gave in to the urge. I started to worry that this would continue indefinitely and that this would inevitably end up leading to depression due to inactivity. At one point I panicked and began forcing myself to get activity even though my body was saying otherwise. Of course this just made me sicker. So, I allowed myself to indulge rest. Depression never came. Instead, eventually, and without forced effort, the urge to just rest and my passion toward my television faded and I began feeling the urge to do other things. Ideas began to form and I began writing. 
This process of letting go to create room for healing to occur reminds me of other sources on this topic of letting go. In terms of the grieving process or recovering from a trauma, therapists tell their patients to allow themselves to feel the pain and express it. If one feels like crying, then cry and do not suppress it. It is part of the healing process. However, patients often resists this due to a fear that if they open the floodgates they will never stop and will fall apart completely. Therapists reassure their patients that in fact this does not occur. There will come a point when you have cried enough and won’t need to continue. You will not fall apart. Letting go of resistance of the pain is necessary to move beyond it.
I think of Pema Chodron speaking on the topic of anxiety and other forms of mental distress as they show up when one is meditating. There is an urge to avoid this from occurring due to fear we cannot bear it. However, Pema states, “if you don’t allow yourself to feel it how will you ever know what is on the other side of it>?” If I hadn’t let go of working and allowed myself to rest, I would likely have continued to decline. 
Letting go was key for me in coping with the physical symptoms of dizziness and oscillopsia. If I resisted through the form of thoughts such as “Oh know”, “this is terrible”, “I can’t handle this”, or “why is this happening”, “what does it mean?”, my relationship with the symptoms tightened and became more unpleasant. If I let go of these thoughts, accepted the symptoms were there, and merely observed what was occurring nonjudgmentally, I felt this relationship shift and become less unpleasant. 
Toni Bernard quotes Ahahn “If you let go a little you will….
Ram Dass
After   began to recover frm the shock and grief reaction I had to retiring, I began to settle in to the new freedom that allowed me to relax and simply be. I did the things I could never get enough of when I was working, such as watching my favorite tv programs and reading.  When I walked the dog in our beautiful neighborhood or sat on my porch swing gazing at my garden and listenin to the birds singing, I thought….”This isn’t so bad. In fact I feel so grateful to have the timeto do this”and “I think I could just do this forever”. I felt relaxed and content in a way that  I never had before when I had. I thought, this is the upside to being sick”. This lasted for a few weeks and then I began to experience a change. The blissfull relaxed feeling left and I began to feel……bored. I cannot recall realy ever feelimg bored before because I hve always been busy and striving towqrds something. There was never time to feel bored. Vacations and weekends never lasted long enough. I but now had and unending vaction stretched out in front of me for the rest of mylife. And  found it is possible to relax too much. 
Of course the psychologist in me could have easily identified and even warned a client who was approaching retirement about this issue. That when you lose the structure of work, you can begin to feel lost understimulated. This can quickly lead into depression. However, somehow when it was happeing to me it was like I was cught by surprise. Luckily my training kicked in and I recognized what I needed was behavioral activation. This is an evidence bssed approach to the treatment of depression. It teaches that depression reveals something is awry with one’s lifestyle. That one is likely not engage in enough pleasurable or rewarding activities. I recalled I did experience depression once years ago when I was a student and doing nothing  but reading and writing papers. I became too understimulated. I quickly and easily fixed this by joining a gym and getting a part time job. As soon as I got moe active, the depression lifted. 
So, unwisely, I began to apply th3 same approach to my current borecom. I frantically began finding things to do to be more active. I began doing more housework, more yardwork, had my husband drive me to Michael’s to search for a craft. I felt sick and exhausted, but ai thought to avoid depression I better push on through these feelings and keep moving. I unwiselythought, I n longer have to worry about wearing myself out so that I could be at my best at work. If I did too much, so what? 
Can you guess what happened? It took basically one dayof this kid of behavior to about 3 days of extremely worsened symptoms and collapse. I could not push through this. I hd no choice but to lay in bed. I could not tolerat3 sitting up or reading due to fatigue an worsened oscillopsia. 
So I think recognized I ws doing exactly what I would hve known to warn pain patients against, overacgivity. Of  ourse I knew the answer to his was pacing oneself. I had typical reaction to this that I have seen in patients. Pacing requires discipline and it is tempting to say, “screw it”. I’m just going to lay here. Finding a balance that works for you and sticking to it is HARD. I felt tempted to let self-pity have a party. This reminded me of a patient with borderline personality who called me for some coaching when in distress. They were participtin in s probram thqt involved learning and practicing coping skills. When I asked what skills th3y could use in the momen to cope, they said “I’m so sick of coping!” I knew how to hande this. I needed to validate their feelings and then encourage them to cope anyway. Now I needed to do this for myself. I needed to acknowledge, yes this is hard and it isn’t fair and now it is time to more forwqrd and cope.  
It was eye opening to see how vast the gap is between seeing how to help others wth their problems and helping oneself with one’s ownproblems. For example, I have listened to many individuals describe problems and their reactions to them and althougb each individual is different, I often felt as if I had heard it before. For example, chronic pain patients feel their suffering is invalidated by medical professionals. Combat Veterans all have different experiences and also struggle with similar issues such as survivor guilt or hypervigilence. Since I talked with so many individuals with similar issues, I would kno just what to say to properlyempathize which oftennsurprised patients. They could not believe someone could get what they are experiencing so quickly. However, oddly when I was facing issues I had heard others descry e before such as dealing with the loss of a csreer and a loss of functioning I felt as if  was the first and only person to ever experien e this. It was baffling.  There is such an enormous difference between understanding something intellectually and experiencing it personally. 
I think that my training and work experience likely helped me to see what was occurring in me more quickly thn I would have otherwise and I am grateful for that. 
For example, I figured out in about day after getting bored and depressed due to nactivity that behaviora activation is what I needed, however it is humbling to recognize how difficult it is to implement the necessary chages. When talking to patients about thi I could easily say and mean, ‘ Iknow it is easier said than done”. Howecer, whenyou are walking in their shoes, you experience this in a whole other way. 
Little coping tools – its amazing how fast you went from professional to white trash; move rooms, chairs, get dressed if even for one hour, make the bed. Be flexible with your new schedule. 

Healthy schedule – juggle a million things with ease; sick schedule work, crash….work, crash. Unemployed and sick requires constant adjustment and small things take a long time. Calling a roofer feels overwhelming.

As a therapiwt I encountered different responses to difficulty. Some people behave passively. They feel helpless and self-pitying and chilelike. The expect if they simply show up for therapy the therapist will fix them and they don’t have to exude any effort. They have a strong external locus of control. These people respond to illness by giving up in an u healthy way that does not utilize helpful coping sgrategies. Some people approach difficulty with an attitude of entitlement. They come to th3ray to vent thei anger about how others, th3 world, institutions, have wronged them. Tney becomestuck on how life is unfair and they got screwed. These keep fighting in an unhealthy way. Then th3re are the achievers. They have a strong internal locus of control and do not feel entitled. These individuals are quick to take tips from the therapist and start using them. They are easier to work with. However, they have often have a major stumbling block which is being too oriented towares self-sufficiency and control. They have a strong need for control. They believe if they strive and work hard then they can make good things happen. I personally csn relat3 more to th4se individuals. I am a Type 
A go getter. However, this becomes challenging when one becomes ill with a chronic condition. Because your usual successful approach of making things happen by working had no longer works. When I was a doctoral student you become wired to work beyond what is comfortale, be constantly challeng3d, and never acknowledge that you can’t handle something. You are being constantly evaluat3d alongside driven, brilliant, competitive peers and must prove you are strong enough to enter the ranks of your profession with the title Ph.D. This is a long, arduous process. You must have a can do attitude. Topics such as self-care are brought up as a side note. You must constantly prove yourself worthy. Those ,then us who survive this process enter the ranks of the employed often as an employers dream. We are self-motivat3d, have excellent interpersonal skills, don’t compliain. When it came to the point thqt I had to discuss my illness with my employer, then ask for FMLA, adjustment of my schedule, and ultimately disability retirement, I felt like a fish out of water. Acknowledging out loud ton an employer that I could not do something was agonizing. I felt as if I had forgotten to wear pants in public. It went against everything I was trained to do. 

Adjust from busy life-> inactivity/boredom
-	Revert to mean – you adjust
-	Hedondic treadmill – let go of money, shopping, stuff, MORE more more….
-	Need slight tweaks, doesn’t  have be muc h, move rooms, make some of meals
-	Before getting sick I would not have been able to imagine being content with this life I have now and yet now that I have adjusted, I cannot fathom how I was able to squeeze in so much into one day!
One major loss that I did not recognize for awhile was how my work as a psychologist fulfilled my need for meaningful conversation. I am a good listener. I become quickly bored with small talk. When talking with patients the conversations focuses on the topics that are of the greatest significance in their life. It focuses on the things that truly matter. The moments that had the most impact on them. The relationships that are closest to them. Their greatest hopes and fears. There is little room for fluff. This is one reason I enjoyed interning with Hospice. Patients preparing for death tend to focus on the things that are most important. Such as searching for meaning as they reflect on their life as a whole, conveying love to family, and discussing death with eagerness as the topic can no longer be avoided.
Nursing home volunteer?  
One of the most excrutiating aspects of adjusting to the loss of income was when my husband had to ask his parents for financial assistance. We had to wait 8 months before we heard whether I would receive disability retirement. This meant 8 months of NO INCOME. This was painful because it reminded too much of my graduate school days watching debt rise with nothing coming in. I am a very proud and independent person. So, the idea of asking my in-laws for money made me squirm. It made me queasy. There were moments before we asked that I announced to my husband I was going back to work no matter if it made me sicker because asking for money was intolerable. He would inevitably respond that that was nuts. He would say although it was uncomfortable, it was obviously the best choice because every time I had tried to do more, such as increase my hours at work, my health had immediately deteriorated. He told me that the idea of me going back to work and declining again was stressful for him as it was so painful to watch when it was occurring. He said, “You just have to accept reality, you’re sick”. 
Of course he was right. This made me think of all the individuals I have seen as a psychologist, mostly men, who are dealing with illness, job loss, and income loss. It was typically due to some kind of injury and resulting physical pain. Those who had been hard working and independent all their lives now were dependent on spouses or the government to “bring home the bacon”. This wreaked havoc on their self-image and sense of worth.  Some needed spouses to provide caregiving tasks and this dependence and vulnerability was humiliating for them. 
I recall offering validation, affirming that I recognized the value they placed on self-sufficiency. I also gently suggested that it is an important skill to learn to accept help and that it takes strength to do so. I would say that since they have given so much to their families in the past, they are giving them a gift by allowing them to return the favor. I would indicate that their family members needed to be able to do this for them. Additionally, I would discuss ways of broadening their identity beyond work to include focusing on other things such as relationships. Not working and being cared for allowed them more time to develop these. This is more of a cognitive approach to the problem as it is suggesting that changing their way of looking at the problem will help. 
Yet here I was facing similar issues and none of these words rang true. I felt I would do anything to twist out of the predicament of asking for help. Then I thought about how an ACT therapist might address it. I thought of videos I have seen of Kelly Wilson, one of the founders of ACT, doing therapy. When the client would express a problem or describe their distress, he would not offer alternate perspectives. He would not offer hope or comfort. He would encourage them to close their eyes and he would also do so. He would then walk them through an impromptu meditation he made up as he went. It would involve exploring, sitting with, opening to, the pain as if it was very important. There would be long pauses and slow deep breaths as he modeled accepting not avoiding what the client was experiencing. It would go something like, “Yes….slow, deep breath…..It is so painful when …….. occurs”. And, “It is so hard to sit with this”. Only this would go on for lengthy periods. So for me, I needed to notice the discomfort of asking for money and then let it be there. It was okay to feel uncomfortable. Kelly would also move on to consider why it is important to stay with the discomfort. It is because it was necessary for the client to pursue some important value of theirs. In my situation it would be that it was important for me to sit with the discomfort of asking for money so that I can honor my value of caring for my health. 
I also thought of Marsha Linehan’s DBT. Individuals with Borderline Personality experience more intense emotions than most of us. As we all want to do when we feel pain they want to escape it somehow. They then often engage in impulsive acts that create trouble in their lives. One of the DBT Skills is to learn to sit with feelings instead of impulsively act on them. If I had acted on my feelings I would have called my supervisor, jumped back into work, and likely spiraled downhill physically again. This would have caused more stress for my husband. Learning to sit with discomfort is a very grown-up thing to do and living well with chronic illness calls for very adult-like behavior. 

Perfectionism
I am a perfectionist but only about things that matter to me. To my mother’s chagrin this has never included housecleaning. Keeping a clean house is of utmost importance to her. I remember during adolescence, standing in my bathroom, being forced to watch her provide a demonstration on how to properly clean. I recall rolling my eyes and trying to fight off a yawn. 
However, when it comes to things that do matter to me, there is a compulsive quality to my perfectionism. It must be perfect and it must be perfect now. In other words I am impatient in my perfectionism. 
When I was working as a psychologist, this applied to my skills as a clinician. I think perfection does not exist in the practice of psychotherapy. One can always find room for improvement. This was difficult for me. I would often go home at the end of the day and think, “If I had only said this or that” or “If I had only phrased it differently”. However, when you get two unique individuals into a room who are trying to meet each other, to connect, things are going to be messy and unpredictable. This became more challenging for me when I would try to learn a new form of treatment, particularly .
Areas where I am noticing my perfectionism being a problem now that I am sick are rather superficial and it is slightly embarrassing that I care so much about them. But I will be brave and share them with you. Two of my hobbies are gardening and home decorating. My husband and I purchased our dream home and it includes a large front yard with large flower garden beds. We do all our yardwork ourselves, and maintenance is a huge task. There is constantly something that needs to be done. My perfectionism shows up here because I am always keenly aware of what needs to be done and I feel uncomfortable until it is done. However, it is impossible to have everything in the yard handled at once. Thus, I am always uncomfortable. Since it is not easy to sit with discomfort, before becoming sick I would work in the yard all day on the weekends until I would crash. There were moments when it was close to finished at once and I loved these. The sense of tangible accomplishment that would come with seeing the fruits of your labor was thrilling after a week of working in the nebulous world of therapy. However, this moments of completeness would not last because weeds would grow, plants would die off and need pruning and on and on….. There is always something left undone that must be tended tomorrow. 
I take great pleasure in sitting on my porch swing, relaxing with a book, and periodically surveying the beauty that is my yard. However, I also have a tendency to be reading and relaxing and then have thoughts begin to bubble up and interfere with my serenity, such as “Those shrubs could do with a pruning” and “The yarrow could use some weeding”, and “The echinachea needs to be dead headed” and “the grass is looking a little long”, etc. You can imagine how quickly my serenity is shattered.   
This became more problematic when I became sick because of my new physical limitations. I can now only work in the yard for between 30 minutes to an hour and only in the cool parts of the day or I greatly worsen my symptoms and end up totally bedbound for days.  Thus, the yard is constantly WAY below the standards of what I would like. And I have to practice not impulsively acting on the urge I have to get to work.   
Recently my husband and I returned from being out of town for about a month. Our yard was a disaster. I told myself, I will just work on it a little each day! But the first day I got started, I became so focused on the totality of the task and the desire for completeness that I kept going, and going, and going. Must husband kept coming outside and saying, “you are looking overheated” and “you are going to overdo it”. I knew he was right and that I should stop. But I didn’t. Finally he practically forced me to come inside. Thank goodness he did. Once I finally stopped working and snapped out of the madness, I realized that I was quivering with exhaustion. My face was bright red from overheating. My oscillopsia was jostling with a vengeance. When I get overheated I inevitably get a migraine. So, I had overdone it and was now going to pay for it. This was very unwise action. 
I also have, frankly, an obsession with making my home beautiful on the inside. Although there are many things I loved about our home when we moved in, I also had an image of how I wanted it to be. This would involve extensive renovations. We have been able to do some of them and I enjoy the result every day. However, now that I am no longer working and thus do not have the income I once had, completing the rest of the renovations is likely no longer in our reach. This is extremely difficult for me to accept. My husband tends to see this in me and thinks it has to do with the hedonic treadmill. He thinks that I always want more…more…MORE! But I don’t think that is it. I think it has more to do with my need for things to be a particular way.  My need for things to be perfect. Thus, I will be relaxing in the living room, enjoying the lovely picture windows we have put in and I will begin thinking, “Everything would be so much better if the kitchen were just painted a different color” and “If only the bathrooms were updated then I could really feel settled!” 
What happens both when thoughts about incompleteness bubble up about the yard and the house is that I miss out on enjoying the beauty that is already there. Pema……
I’ve found several aspects of mindfulness helpful with my perfectionism. First of all, simply noticing that this process is occurring is mindful. It means I am awake. I’m paying attention to the habits of my mind. Because I am aware I then have a choice about what comes next. So, when I notice this process occurring, I begin to identify the thoughts, “Oh there is perfectionism showing up”. I don’t beat up on myself for this, I simply notice and redirect. I gently bring my focus back to whatever I am doing in the moment, reading a book, watching television, cooking dinner, listening to the birds. My thoughts about getting things just right inevitably resurface and I gently coral my mind back to what I am doing in the moment. 
I also reflect on the concept of being vs doing. When I am focused on everything that needs to be done to perfect my yard and my home my mind is in doing mode. It is only a short step away for me to begin physically overdoing. So, I try to shift into a more being state. For me this involves a settling into my body and into the moment as it is. It involves somehow embracing my surroundings as they are, imperfections and all. When this occurs there is a softening inside my mind. The frantic need to fix things settles down. And I begin to let go of perfection and enjoy what I already have. 
A cognitive therapist would approach this problem differently. They might try to appeal to my rationale mind by making arguments about why perfection is impossible. They might encourage me to challenge my thoughts with alternate self-talk such as “The house is good enough” or “Things don’t need to be perfect”. What I find most helpful about cognitive therapy is how it highlights how our thoughts can be so problematic. I can recognize perfectionism when it arises and get some distance from it because I am aware of how cognitive therapy teaches that it is ………. However, beyond the increased capacity to identify problematic thought patterns, I don’t find the process of challenging them with alternate thoughts particularly helpful. I find the use of mindfulness in working with thoughts personally to be more helpful.  
Allowing Thomas to help, accepting help
Beach reflections: I found myself thinking of this during a trip to the ocean recently. While spending some time at the beach recently. I sat on the sand for awhile, taking in the view. Then after about thirty minutes I thought, “Well, I’ve done it now, blue water, white sand, very nice. But what should I do next?” I felt restless and bored. I thought about how quickly the thrill of something new wears off. Then I decided this was a good opportunity to practice staying put with boredom and experimenting with mindfulness. So I sat and sat. And I paid attention. After awhile, I began to see more than I did initially. I noticed how the cloud formation kept changing in interesting ways. I noticed how many different shades of blue and green there were in the water. I counted about five different types of sea birds around. Some would soar, dive, and come out of the water with a fish. Some looked comical as they scurried across the sand. I was especially amused when a sand crab came up out of its sand cave and looked at me. I noticed how goofy they look with their eyes way above their body, peering around. The way it walked reminded me of MC Hammer and the sideways dance he made famous in the early 1990s when I was in high school. I giggled when I thought how ridiculous it looked now. The crab kept coming out and peering at me. He would sit there as if saying “Who are you?” Then I noticed a fin come up out of the water a little off the coastline. Then another and another. Dolphins. Every so often they would pop up, show their fin, and then their tail as they dove back down into the water. It looked like they were playing with each other. I was grinning. Had I not sat through my initial boredom I would have left with only a superficial experience. When I allowed myself to sit with the boredom and just be, new layers of experience emerged. This reminds me of the marvelous power of mindfulness meditation. 
Of course you may be reading this and thinking, how hard is it to enjoy sitting at the beach? I wish I had that problem. I can’t argue with that. But this experience reminded me of mindfulness in a couple of ways.
First, as many have discussed before, our modern life is hurried. We are busy and we are stressed. We are obsessed with productivity and with action. It seems there is never enough time in the day to get everything accomplished. I was certainly programmed this way until getting sick. Once I got sick I had to learn to slow down. My body decided for me that it was time to spend more time being than doing (Berhnard).  Once I finally accepted this and began letting go of my compulsive need to accomplish, my mindset began to shift. The motor inside began to quiet. When this occurred I gradually began noticing, observing the simple aspects of life with greater clarity and appreciation. Whereas once I would have rushed through my day and then crumpled into a vegetative heap, I now began to notice the pleasure of sipping on my morning coffee and savoring it. I began to notice the way the light changes in my house as the sun moves through the sky. I began to enjoy unloading my dishwasher at a leisurely pace. Not in any hurry to get it done. 
One major change is that I was actually focusing on the task I was doing and it alone. I was also doing it without a sense of urgency. I began enjoying cooking for the first time because it was my major activity for the day and not something I had to do as an afterthought at the end of a strenuous day. In the past when I have cooked I have felt that every moment must be filled with something. For example, whenever there is a break such as waiting for the water to boil or waiting between steps with a timer going, I would feel the need to wander off and do something else. This would often result in cooking mistakes. However, I felt somehow there could not be empty time, unfilled time. I couldn’t just be. However, as described above, this has changed since becoming sick and learning to slow down. 
It has created space for mindful awareness. It opened up a whole new world to be appreciated. Tasks that were tedious and boring that had previously been done mindlessly, became pleasurable. 
This is one of the gifts of becoming sick. It creates the space for you to enter into this world. This is also a way to adapt to your new limited sphere of existence. If you are housebound, or bedbound, there is still a world to be discovered. The changing of the seasons outside your window. The feeling of soft sheets enveloping you. One of my favorite aspects of lying in bed or on my porch swing is listening to the birds. This is a truly mindful practice and is thrilling. It is remarkably pleasant to close your eyes and listen. As I do this, my mind wanders off of course; however the melodic sounds of my chirping friends is there to coax me back into the present moment. 
Over the years that I worked with Veterans, particularly combat Veterans, they became dear to me. I worked with them therapeutically for years and then changed roles and did disability assessments. I felt a strong sense of purpose when I went to work. Every time I listened to one of them tell their story and I was able to offer support I felt I was using my time for something very important. I went home at the end of the day with a sense of fulfillment. Of course this was also challenging and took its toll on me physically and emotionally. The first few times I heard the gory details of combat and witnessed a young strapping soldier or marine burst into tears, I could feel the cortisol pumping through my body as if I was there on the streets of Kabul and Tikrit. At the end of the day my muscles ached from head to toe. However, as is common when we do things repeatedly, I eventually became desensitized and could hear these stories with genuine empathy, but not be distressed. However, after hearing variations of these stories hundreds upon hundreds of times, I would have moments when I would feel weighed down with sadness about the enormity of the problem. I heard tales of carnage that spanned from Iwo Jima, to the Tet Offensive in Vietnam, to Baghdad and Afghanistan.  I would be struck by the sheer numbers of those whose lives had been forever changed by combat. World War II Veterans, such as the Veteran I interviewed who was one of the few survivors of Iwo Jima, worried that future generations would forget what had occurred there. Aging Vietnam Veterans, some whose bodies are now broken down from the years of abusing substances to try to cope with their memories without the assistance that is available now to our returning troops. Some who are retiring after years of using work as a way to avoid dealing with their memories are now forced to grapple with them. The young boys aged 20 something who now carried the weight of the world on their shoulders. Each story was unique yet filled with common themes such as survivor guilt and difficulty adjusting back to civilian life. Despite my moments of sadness, it felt good to help in some way. It felt good to point them forward and discuss how they are not alone and how recovery is possible. I was also never bored for one moment. When my body forced me to leave, I felt as if I had abandoned them. Over time I have come to see that this is the most painful aspect of losing my career. I can only think of it briefly before I have to change my focus because the guilt feels unbearable. I have to remind myself that at this time I must focus on caring for myself.
I am writing these reflections on working with Veterans during my trip to the ocean. While enjoying looking out at the lovely, calming water, I feel especially guilty that I am not back in my office working. I think that I am writing this book in part to assuage that guilt. This reminds me of the survivor guilt combat Veterans feel when they get to return home and their buddies do not. They are afraid to allow themselves to move on and enjoy life because their buddies cannot. I feel guilty enjoying myself at the beach when I know there is so much work still to be done for our Veterans. I would tell them to honor their friends by living fully. I must honor myself by resting fully. As I encouraged them to accept their humanness in the context of being unable to a friend, I too must accept my limitations and humanness. For me this means that at this time, I am too ill to work.

Jack Kornfield’s discussion of identification with roles, self-image vs no-self. I have been attached to my role as psychologist. My self-image is attached to smart, knowledgable, someone others come to for help. I’m use to being treated with respect as an expert in the workplace – called doctor, have a gatekeeper others mustgo through to see me, have degrees hanging on my wall, being in a position of power, hearing others express appreciation frequently. Now I am in the sick role. All those aspects have been ripped away. I mostly see family who does not see me as “doctor” and does not treat me as “doctor”. I feel as though I am now primarily seen as the “sick one”. This is hard on the ego. Jack Kornfiedl discusses how if we identify too much with certain roles and with a particularly self-image, we will suffer when those change. And they will inevitably change. Everyone has to grapple with an aging body, with changing roles from career person to retiree, from parent to having grown children, from healthy to a gradually aging bnody. Now that I am grappling with such issues due to illness I have a new understanding for others grappling with change and loss of roles and self-image. Although I have worked with many who are grappling with retirement and the loss of things such as a driver’s license, I have known what to say intellectdually and delivered it kindly. Such as a recognition that people resist losing their driver’s license even when the facts indicate they are no longer safe behind the whell. Intellectually I have known that this is because they don’t feel ready to let go of their feeling of indepencence and being able to drive oneself around is an enormous symbol of this. But I admit that I did not understand fully because I had not experienced this myself. On some level, although I wouldn’t say it, I would think, “You need to deal with reality, you are getting older and are a menace on the streets”, Just accept it. But now that I have lost control over how others’ view me and lost the role that gave my life meaning and pride, I get much more deeply how hard it is to surrender to reality and how painful it can be when you realize that other’s do not view you the way you are use to.

I think that adjusting to the life of a chronically ill person is one time in my life when being an introvert has served as an advantage. 
There are lots of little things that I have found can make a difference in bolstering my mood and avoiding depression. Doing just a couple of things on my to do list. Moving rooms. Mixing up my routine (i.e. type of exercise). Going on a small outing even if I don’t feel well physically, my mood is lifted by the time I get home. Varying things like television, reading, internet activity, cooking, cleaning to different times of the day or doing more or less depending on the day. There are days when I can tell I have a little more energy and am losing interest in tv. I then get more active and do some housework. Whereas there are days when my body screams “no activity!” and all I can do is watch tv. On these days I move from my bedroom to our guest room where I have a tv set up. So, I crawl out of one bd and into another. This has two advantages, to practice good sleep hygiene I avoid spending the day in the bed where I need to sleep at night. It also gives me some variation in my scenery. There are different things to look at outside my window. 
When I was working, my husband did most of the cooking. He is an awesome cook and I reveled in being pampered with delicious meals at the end of the day. However, now that I am sick, I’ve found that cooking is something I usually have just enough energy to do. It doesn’t take much mental energy and if I engage with it mindfully, I even find it relaxing. It has given me a energy appropriate acdtivity to fill my time and make me feel I am contributing to the home. Cooking a healthy meal and then sitting down to share it with someone gives me a great sense of accomplishment. It also has been a lovely contrast to the heady type work I have always done. It gives me the opportunity to do something hands on and creative.  I’ve enjoyed exploring this different part of myself. But I have had to find ways to be flexible with it. My husband has to do the grocery shopping because going to a busy store aggravates my neurological symptoms and is extremely taxing. So he ensures that all the ingredients are there when I need them. Also, I have a crock pot and love making slow cooker meals. On days when I feel decent in the morning, I prepare a slow cooker meal and then by evening, when I usually don’t feel as good, the food is ready to go. Other days I wake up feeling like hell and then have meals I can make that require brief preparation. I rest all day and by afternoon usually feel good enough to make something. 
My point in describing all this is that adapting to living well while being chronically ill and mostly homebound sometimes bedbound requires creativity and flexibility. What works for you is probably different than what works for me. And what works might change. Something might feel enjoyable or work well for awhile and then becomes boring or unworkable. So I encourage you to experiment. Try different approaches to how you spend your time knowing that sometimes what seems like small acts or subtle changes in routine can make huge difference. Keep tweaking things and don’t stay stuck and give up. 
As discussed earlier, Pema Chodron has highlighted fundamental ambiguity of being human. Life is ever changing, yet we want to cling to a fixed state. She extends this to a tendency to cling to a fixed identify or way of viewing who we are. We develop a particular story about who we are and become rigid in what we tell ourselves about this. However, our stories can change. Within ACT we are taught to “hold our stories lightly”. As a therapist, I have seen people struggle over this when they retire or become disabled. They may have become set in a fixed identity about themselves such as “I am a hard worker” or “I am a provider” or “I am self-sufficient” or “I am a manager” or “I am a soldier”. Then when this is lost, the person may feel lost. I have heard many in this situations state that there is no longer any point to their life. However, if we can learn to hold our stories lightly and as Pema would say, embrace the groundlessness of our existence, we might be able to better adapt the change in circumstances. For example, when one is no longer able to be the provider for a family, they may now have the opportunity to develop other aspects of their identity. They may be able to nurture neglected relationships and learn to accept help and love from others. When one is no longer able to be a “hard worker” that person might now have the time to learn how to focus more on exploring what give them pleasure and on learning how to play. If we embrace change we might find it rich with opportunity. 
In my case my identity was very developed around the concept of myself as psychologist. This involved the daily experience of being a professional, respected, in service to others, and a hard worker. When I lost this aspect of my identity it was initially painful. However, over time I have come to see it as have both aspects of loss and gain. I have gained the opportunity to be more vulnerable, close and interdependent in my relationships as I learn to accept help, restful, stress-free, creative, attentive to my health, to simply be, to choose each moment how I will spend my precious time. 
Although I may be chronically ill and medically retired, I am also ALIVE! And the fact that my diagnosis is not terminal means that I can embrace every moment that I get to keep living. Even thought I am much more limited and my world is smaller, it is mine and I choose to be grateful for every breath. I choose to appreciate everything about life that I can engage with. Because of this I find that I now take great pleasure in things I barely noticed, such as tasting my food, making my bed, taking a hot shower, watching the seasons change, walking my dog, laughing with my hubbie. None of it is to be taken for granted.    
One thing I have found that is sure to destroy my happiness is envy. Toni Bernhard dicusses how envy about what others can do that she cannot and makes her feel sorry for herself and unhappy. She uses the concept of Toglen to cope with this. I also have found that a sure fire way to make myself miserable is to think about how unfair it is that I am sick and others are not. I know that it is said that if you look hard enough you will find that everyone has suffering in their lives in one form or another. However, I swear that I know a small number of people who seem to be relatively untouched by it. These are people who have been very fortunate in life. They have wealth, health, and love in their lives. They have never suffered considerable loss or stress. Life honestly appears to be a breeze for them. If I spend time focusing on these people, I begin to get really unsatisfied with my situation. In contrast to them, I feel so unfortunate I this brews feelings of resentment. What a recipe for misery! What I do when this surfaces, is to think about one technique from Dialectical Behavioral Therapy. Instead of focusing on those who are better off than you, think about those who are not. Maybe watch a movie about someone dealing with tragic circumstances. This may seem heartless but what it does is provide perspective. There will always be people who have it better than you, but there are also likely many who have it worse. If you dwell on comparing yourself with those better off you will ruin the happiness that is available to you in life. I have counseled individuals who are stuck here. They may have had an injustice done to them at some point that changed the course of their life. If they continue to hold on to this and ruminate about it they will be miserable. One individual focused on how others had more prestigious careers and wealth. He would sit in the mall during the holidays and watch people buying expensive presents and stew on the fact that he could not afford to do this. I suggested to him that he spend his time volunteering at a homeless shelter instead and see how that impacted his perspective and mood. Happiness researchers have told us that comparing ourselves to those who have more is a sure way to feel less happy. Pema Chodron tells us that happiness comes from embracing our life just as it is. Being happy with what we have is the key. And it is a choice we can make.  
I have noticed I can at times be judgmental. I tend to get angry about people who have been blessed with great fortune and do not use it to help others. People who choose to focus all their time and money on themjselves or their immediate family, having biological children and then checking out of the world. 
In conclusion, I have been surprised to find how well I have adjusted to such a radical change in my life. When I first discontinued work, it took time for me to adjust. My previous life had included a rich supply of meaningful interactions with others, a high level of productivity, daily intellectual stimulation, and enough of a financial cushion to afford things I didn’t  need like fancy vacations and clothes. All of that has changed and felt like an excrutiating loss at first. But over time and after being forced to let go of things, I have found just as much enjoyment in a simple life. I find this comforting to discover. If you are a healthy person I hope you find it comforting to hear from someone on the other side of healthy saying that a joyful life kind be found in the midst of circumstances you might fear. nOf course people are different and I’m sure my being an introvert has made it easier for me to find fulfilomentin my quiet life.Long before becoming sick I required less external, particularly social, stikulation than an extrovert. But I think that even extroverts can adapt to whatever life deals them with a little creativity and acceptance. People can adapt to challenges worse than mine. I cannot imagine how hard it must be to live with constant pain. However, I know people who do this and still find that there is live beyond their pain. Their pain is still bothersome and yet they are more than their pain. My grandparents lost their youngest daughter when she was 18. She was killed by a drunk driver. The  heartache they feel about his is never gone, but they have also gone on to have a rich and joyful life. Their life has been about more than this one horrific tragedy.  
When I was working at the VA, my office was small and windowless. I spent 40 hours per week in this space. I really despised this set up. I often requested being transferred to a windowed office but they were rare and it never happened. Now that I am stuck at home, spending much of my time in bed, I deliberately lay in one of our guestrooms that happens to be bright and sunny. I lay in there with the sun streaming in on me and feel grateful for this aspect of my current situation. Of course I could spend time dwelling on all the things I have lost, and these dimensions are easy to find. but I find it so helpful to make a point of noticing the good things that can come with unforeseen negative changes in life.  My point is embrace the life you have, whatever that may be. 
Referring back to concept of dialectics used in dBT, I can hold things together that may seem mutually exclusive to some. I can say with conviction that my body is sick and yet I LOVE life.  
Turing Strawto Gold post – Wisdom of Ancient Greeks
The other day my father made a comment when we were having an intellectual discussion about the topic of euthanasia. He had recently attended a lecture by a physician who strongly opposed the sanctioning of it. Then, the discussion turned more personal. My dad stated that he hopes that he remains totally healthy, without limitations, and then dies suddenly in his sleep. His worst fear is to fail slowly and have to deal with chronic issues that limit his independence and functionality. He does everything he can do to avoid poor health through strenuous exercise and a vegan diet. His hobby is attending conferences about the latest in living healthier for longer through diet. His perspective is understandable. Slow decline and issues of dependence are not fun to face. However, living as a 40 year old with debilitating chronic illness, the message I hear is that he sees living with situation such as mine as nearly intolerable. I think his feeling is that life is only worth living when you are healthy. He certainly did not intend to communicate this, but it is the message. He has said that if he was in my situation and could not exercise vigorously, he would “go crazy”. 
It is a strange thing to realize others view one’s predicament as this pathetic. I certainly do not feel the way he does. Yes, I have many limitations, but there are also many things I still can enjoy. I love life and see it is absolutely worth living just the way it is for me. I wish I could do more, but am thankful for what I can still do. I wonder, am I more equipped to deal with this kind of life or maybe we just surprise ourselves at what we can adapt to when we have to? I don’t think I need as much stimulation as my dad does to feel happy. And I think that being a woman makes it a little easier to cope with some loss of independence. But I think he would find ways to adapt to being capable of less if he chose to. 
The main issue this encounter raises for me is that I loathe being pitied and perceived as pitiful. The lesson for me is to learn to let go of concern over how others perceive me and my life. I am happy and feel worthwhile in spite of my limitations. So what if others can’t see that.  This is easier said than done for me, because I am proud. But I know this is the concept I need to work with. 
When talking about how I was able to accept my circumstances faster because of how I had observered patients get stuck on “this isn’t fair”, and learned how to make yourself miserable. Dr. Schenkel said, yea, instead of saying “why me” you said, “why not me?” and got focused on moving with the current of the stream instead of fighting it. 

Chapter Nine
Pacing
I have always had a can do attitude when it comes to going after things I want or handling obstacles life throws me. When I worked as a social work case manager, I pushed and pushed against various bureaucratic obstacles to get my elderly clients the services they needed. When I decided to get a Ph.D., I made it happen. This involved years and years of persistance in the face of challenges. This once involved vomiting in my car while driving the two hour commute to one of my training sites during graduate school. I simply cleaned myself off and kept on going. I once got lost in the middle of skid row in downtown Los Angeles on my way to interview for my internship. I simply got on the phone with my father and had him navigate with me by looking at online maps until I reached my destination. I was shaken but rocked my interview and got the spot. When I was single and living in a new town I went out on the town alone to meet new friends and met my husband. I am not prone to depression; however the one time I recall being seriously depressed as soon as I realized that is what it was I joined a gym and got a part time job to increase my activity level/stimulation to combat the depression. It lifted quickly afterwards. I am not one to sit around and wallow. I like to go after things and make them happen. I am a hard, diligent worker. I have in the past been easily irritated by people who take on a victim or helpless approach to life or who are just lazy and irresponsible. However, my can do and push through the pain attitude has not worked with chronic illness. In fact is has humbled me to think about how many people I may have judged unfairly who appeared to be lazy and were just dealing with some challenge I could not see. 
I Balance activity an rest – ever shifting
Flexibility
Mindfulness helps notice energy envelope
Need to listen to my body – complex - Sometimes rest is best, sometimes need some activity for stimulation. Sometimes both are true simultaneously and must make wise choice. i.e. mowing when fatigued but restless.   
Ucla – negative response when I asked about getting lunch.
On days I feel better than usual, I tend to forget that I am sick. Sometimes I get caught up in old patterns of rigid productivity. For example, even though the same scenario has played out numerous times, I still get caught up in the following pattern. After weeks of living within a workable routine that involves diligently resting and not overexterting, I start to feel better and gradually become capable of accomplishing more. Then I invite family over for a meal partly in an attempt to try to make up for how absent I have been. I cook and I interact for several hours. I know from experience that I will pay a price for this and I have decided it is worth it. I acknowledge that I will need recovery time. However, I am never realistic about how much recovery time. The day after the big event, when I wake up feeling like I have been hit by a truck, I smile knowingly and patiently spend the day in bed. But typically after one day I expect to resume the routine that was previously working. I have things on my to do list that need to get accomplished and I want to start tackling them. However, my body typically yells at me, “Not yet!” or “Forget it!” I eventually have to surrender and then I get caught up in frustration that I cannot do what I want to do. I have to go through the process of accepting that I am sick, yet again, and letting go of my plans. It usually takes about a week for me to bounce back from a 2-3 hour social engagement. I hope that one day I will learn this once and for all.   
Although my stress level has dropped astronomically since I stopped working, other stressors do arise. For example, if there is some trouble or conflict in the family that triggers my stress response, something that would have been merely a blip on my radar before becoming sick, I am now crushed by it. Stress ravishes my body and knocks me down, similarly to overexertion. Although I try to avoid stress, it is an unavoidable part of life. So, I have to accept that when this happens I am going to have to again, let go of what I have been doing, and crawl in bed for days. There is no pushing through it to keep going. I ache all over, cannot think clearly, and feel like there is an elephant sitting on top of me. 
So I rest, read, watch tv, and meditate. Gradually I come back to life and get back on my slightly less limited track. I can once again make some meals, tidy the house, and do some writing. These fluctuations in my functional level affects my husband’s life too. This is because when I am knocked down, he has to do more of the chores, particularly cooking and cleaning up. I am blessed to be with a man who never complains about this and just goes with the flow. However, when I am back on my feet he milks it a little by laying helplessly on the couch asking me to bring him things to pamper him a bit. This is partly a joke and partly him enjoying being taken care of a bit too. I enjoy it because I get to feel useful. It makes for a nice reciprocal relationship.   
So, this is the rythym of my life and it is constantly changing. I find my groove, then have to reign it in and then let the reigns out, over and over again. Being chronically ill means learning to be incredibly flexibility. 
Ellis – “Don’t should  on yourself”
Biking, gardening, juggling light, position I lay …….headaches. Since exercise suppose to help and gaining wight, can’t fit clothes, started biking to avoid heat. Led daily migraines. Tempting say screw this and poor me. Also very understandable. But only makes worse. Instead must get creative and try something else. 
I try to find ways to get as much of the things that I truly enjoy in my life as possible given my limitations. (Reference chapter on things that nourish you from MBCT. Some of these things may seem silly to others, however I have learned that worrying about trying to be “normal” or what other’s think is a big fat waste of time and also a good way to make myself miserable. Instead I try to focus on being true to myself and what makes me happy. I find that this is even more important now that I am sick. I am already limited by my illness, adding the burden of other people’s expectations on top of that is just too soul destroying. So, I have let go (to an imperfect degree) of keeping my yard perfectly maintained for the neighbors. I have let go of having my house perfectly cleaned for company. I get dressed in my professional attire when I write because it makes me feel motivated. This means I put on work clothes for about 1-2 hours only and then have to get back into my pajamas. But I still do it. No one else sees me. This felt silly at first, but it is effective to help motivate me and help me connect to my former professional self, even if for brief periods. I enjoy it. If you are reading this and are male, you may want to tune out now. I have always loved fashion. It is superficial and meaningless, but it is a hobby that amuses me. For the first year I was sick, I mostly just lived in my pajamas and didn’t go anywhere. Now when possible, I will accompany my husband to the grocery store and make a point of getting dolled up. Being at the store is very taxing on me, so he does all the think and I just follow him around. But it gives me a chance to connect with the world and have and outing. I try to make the most of it by getting dressed nicely vs just wearing sweats. My husband finds this odd as he could not care less about what he is wearing. He always looks baffled when I come out of our room after getting ready because he doesn’t get the point and also because he is so used to seeing me unkempt. But for me it is meaningful and pleasurable. My point in sharing this with you is to encourage you to not let chronic illness cause you to give up everything you enjoy. But instead to get creative about bringing as much joy to your life as you can, no matter how odd or small it is. Thinking about the things that gave you pleasure before you got sick can be a guide. Or you may want to explore new things that fit better into your life as a sick person. Enjoyment can still be had when you are sick, it just looks different than it did before.  
Avoiding headache and faigue triggers is like living sober when you have an addiction. I recall working with Veteran’s who were a part of the VA’s substance abuse program had to keep their sobriety in mind at all times. They had to be self-disciplined about avoiding triggers as their utmost concern. This was a drag for them at times. But if they slipped up such as wandering into a bar, the cost could be high. So too I have to be self-discplined about my lifestyle in order to avoid migraines and excessive fatigue. This can be a drag. However, I know that many of those Veteran’s I am referring to somehow found a sense of meaning, a sense of purpose in this lifestyle. They drew a sense of pride and accomplishment for their days of sobriety. The path of sobriety gave them a sense of direction. So, I must make peace with the restrictions now on my life and accept that this is now a big part of my journey and that is just the way it is. It is just my journey, there is nothing wrong with it.  
Having a sense of meaning and purpose in one’s life is important. I have had dto make adjustments here also. When well I gained much sense of meaning from my work with Veterans. I felt my net for who I helped was case fairly wide. Since becoming sick I have had to look elsewhere for a sense of purpose. I have had too cast my net must smaller. I now find purpose in the act of managing my illness as best that I can. This is a full time job and is more self-focused than how I am use to living. However, if I am not diligent about prioritizing self-care, my health takes more of a nosedive and this then effects my husband. When I am sicker, it causes him stress, worry, sadness, and he has to do more for me. When I take good care of myself, I am less of a burden. Finding meaning in being the best wife I can be would not have been enough for me when I was well. However, now that I have more limitations, it is plenty to give meaning to my daily actions. Prioritizing my health because I value both my husband’s and my own well-being is purposeful. This looks nothing like saving the world as I wanted to when I was young. However, it is perfectly noble, as it is the best I can do at this time. 
When I think of finding creative, small ways to infuse one’s life with meaning I think of a patient I once had who had a severe mental illness that was so debilitating they could hold down work. Instead of simply isolating at home, this person took their sweet natured dog and spent time at nursing homes several days per week. They often did not feel like it and due to social anxiety did not know what to say to the residents. However, they would sometimes just sit in silence with people and let them pet the dog. This was enough and it was the best she could do.  
I love to work in my garden. I even enjoy the mundane task of weeding. If left unchecked I will work without stopping until I crash. Because of both my fatigue and my tendency to get headaches from gardening, I have set a policy that when weeding, I can only fill one bucket per day and then I have to stop. This keeps me from overdoing. However, getting myself to stick to this rule waxes and wanes. My husband is much better than I at regulating my behavior and both notices and reminds me (yells “go inside!”) when it is time to quit. Some days I am better at abiding than others. Finding a good balance between avoiding pain and enjoying the freedom to do what you love is quite tricky. At times I say, “the hell with it” and keep going with what I want to do. Other days I am more cautious. I try to be mindful as much as possible so that I am making conscious choices about which direction to go. Going completely one direction or another is not wise. That is, life lived rigidly means less pain, yet is joyless. On the other hand, ignoring one’s body comes at a high price and becomes unworkable over time. My husband is much better at the rigid side than me so I am glad I have him as an anchor, reigning me in when I want to throw caution to the wind. This experience reminded me of a former patient whose greatest love in life was mowing lawns on his riding mower. He loved it so much that he volunteered to do the neighbors yards. He lived in the country so this meant big yards. Similar to myself he had a compulsive streak and had a hard time stopping before the job was done even if his body was telling him to. He had severe back pain that was only exacerbated by his mowing. Likely due to the jostling of the mower. At times as I have been moving beyond my one basket limit I think of that man and smile as I see his behavior in myself. At the time I was working with him I recall being somewhat confused at the rigidity of his behavior. Now that I catch myself doing the exact same thing I have become more aware of how difficult it was for him and have felt a greater sense of compassion towards his predicament. I wish I could have conveyed this compassion better at the time. For him to stop mowing was equivalent with giving up on life and he even stated that he might as well end it all when the day came that he truly had to. Of course this represented deeper issues about accepting aging, loss of independence, and death that had to be addressed.       
It is one thing to learn to say no to yourself when you need to slow down. It is another thing to say no to others. I have found it very difficult to acknowledge my limitations when it means disappointing someone else. My husband has learned this about me and double, even triple checks when I agree to do something that I am actually up to it. I try to do better in this area because if I push myself when my body says not to, I will likely get a flare up of symptoms, which will cause my husband my stress to observe than if I had just said no to some activity in the first place. But others are slower to learn about my limitations. No matter how many times I have tried to explain them to certain family members, they do not seem to learn and continue to seem surprised that I cannot do more. Others do not know because I do not want them to know. I am a proud person and do not want to be seen as sickly. I only spend time with these people when I am at my best. My husband pointed out that because I do this they are baffled when at other times I say that I am too sick to do something. They only see me when I don’t seem sick. Thus, trying to hide my illness because of concern about how others view me has backfired. The answer to dealing with all of these interpersonal scenarios is to let go of concern or a need to control how others view me and to let go of my need to please. I must accept that some people with have unflattering views of me and that some people will be disappointed with me. I wish I could just say “who cares!” or “screw ‘em” like my husband does. But for the reality is that I have to learn to sit with a degree of discomfort in this arena without being able to fix it while continuing strive to let go more fully. 



 Chapter Ten
The Gift of Illness
Let me start by addressing the title of this chapter. By the “gift” of illness, I in no way mean to imply that suffering is good or that all suffering is okay. While Buddhist teachings that it is all okay have helped me with my particular situation, there is suffering in this world that I cannot say is okay.  As a psychologist I have encountered individuals whose suffering so towers over mine that mine seems equivalent to a paper cut in comparison. I think of individuals who have experienced severe, horrific child abuse from an early age resulting in the development of multiple personalities just to cope. I think of individuals who have experienced the death of a child. I have never felt so inadequate in terms of having something to offer than when parents grieving the death of a child came to me for therapy. The best I could do was be willing to sit with them in the midst of their pain without running away. One Veteran in particular comes to mind. He had not only lost a child, but it was unclear whether the child’s death was a suicide or not. This left gaping questions such as if it was suicide, why did he do it? On top of all that, this individual was burdened with horrific memories of combat in Vietnam. Additionally, he was suffering from severe physical pain and limited mobility. 
Saying something trite such as that good things can come out of bad or asking the Veteran to try and find what is positive about his son’s death would be ridiculous and cruel in such a context. However, I must add that there is hope for having a meaningful and fulfilling life for all such individuals and that it is possible to use such pain for good such as motivation to help others. 
Then there are individuals suffering with illness that is life threatening, like cancer. Although such individuals do find positive things about this experience, such as a new appreciation for each moment, I would be very wary of pointing this out for them and thus invalidating their pain. 
However, speaking from my particular vantage point, that of someone with a non-life threatening chronic illness who has had to give up their career, I have found that illness has brought me some positive experiences in addition to the suffering and the loss. Others with chronic illness who have written about it describe the unexpected blessings that have come with illness, such as becoming motivated to get serious about self-care or slowing down. Toni Bernhard stated that a moment came were “I looked around and saw that there were many things….” I have found noticed three gifts that chronic illness has brought to my life. 
By forcing me to let go of my many work responsibilities, chronic illness has created space in my life. With this space and slower pace I have been able to enter into a more Being state of existence. Prior to these events I lived primarily in a Doing state of existence. I would try to make room for meditation; however found it very difficult to follow through. I was tired at the end of my workday that I could do little else but crash in front of the television.
Being forced to lie in bed because my body just wouldn’t permit me to do anything else, frankly gave me permission to gradually stop relentlessly thinking, planning, organizing, doing and just be with myself. This allowed me to gradually connect more with the present moment, which is a truly wonderful blessing. Present moment focus allows me to appreciate my life as it is unfolding. I am better able to appreciate my husband, my home, the beauty of nature that surrounds our home, the joy of cooking a meal, the simple things because I am now more mentally present for them.
This is something I believe is available to everyone, including those living busy work filled lives. However, one has to be deliberate and disciplined about it. It is harder to connect to the present, to switch from doing to being mode, when you are busy and have many responsibilities. Chronic illness makes it easier for me to be present by slowing me down and freeing me up.
This makes me think of a quote provided by Toni Bernhard in How to Be Sick, “If ….it’s okay, if ….. that’s okay too”.  
Another gift that has come my way is that prior to getting sick, there were moments when I questioned my life choices such as pursuing a Ph.D. in psychology. I sometimes thought, “Why did I choose such a long, hard, and expensive path?” I could help people and do therapy with a 1-2 year degree, but I chose to go all the way. While in graduate school and feeling burned out, my fellow students and I would fantasize about less intellectually challenging careers such as being a hairdresser or owning a cupcake bakery. When I became ill and then had to retire, I initially looked for non-intellectual activities to pass my time. I did find I enjoyed cooking, but other things I tried like making hand-made cards quickly bored me. Then gradually and naturally I found myself raising questions that led me to do the research and writing involved with this book. I found that even when I didn’t have to, I wanted to think and learn. I realized I truly value the pursuit of truth, knowledge, and wisdom even if it is hard. By pursuing a Ph.D., I had in fact chosen a great path for myself. Going all the way in school was the best way for me to pursue my quest for truth about the big things in life. Thus, having the free time that came with being sick helped me get reconnected with what really matters to me and feel good about the choices I have made in life.  
Another gift chronic illness has brought to my life lies within my relationship with my husband. Many of the patients I have worked with who were retired or on disability for illness, typically chronic pain, were grappling with issues related to accepting help from family members who had become caregivers. They were almost entirely men because I have mostly worked with the Veteran population. They had spent many years working hard and being the primary breadwinner. Their identity was wrapped up in being independent and being a provider. They lost this capacity, often after an injury on the job or after returning emotionally or physically scarred by combat, and became dependent. For many this led to feelings of helplessness, worthlessness, and depression. Much of our work together involved helping them learn to accept help and to redefine their identity in other ways, such as by being a loving husband and father. By having more time at home they had more time to foster deeper relationships. 
When I got sick I found myself grappling with many of the same issues.  I tended to strive too much towards independence and self-sufficiency. I have a difficult time asking for and receiving help from others. This has to do, somewhat paradoxically, with both pride and also a sense that I am worthy and lovable only because I work hard and don’t ask for much. My husband was drawn to me in part because I was an independent career woman. Because I knew this I felt that I needed to maintain this strong role or he would regret marrying me.  When I became ill and could do less and less for myself, I felt panicked about leaning on him. However, because my body did not give me much of a choice in the matter, I was forced into a position of vulnerability and into accepting care. Over time I began to realize that this did not diminish his love for me. Instead being needed was something he embraced. He stepped up times 10 and this showed me another side of him. When the chips were down he did not run away. Instead he responded with compassion and care. I gradually learned that my husband is capable of great love and I am worthy of receiving it. My respect and certainly my love for him has grown through this experience. My own self-compassion and sense of self-worth has grown. The result is that we have most certainly grown closer as a couple and as individuals.    
Finally, chronic illness has helped me grapple with and come closer to an acceptance of our pervasive human tendency to with to deny our mortality. Ernest Becker writes in the Denial of Death……… Sogyal Rinpoche writes in the Tibetan Book of Living and Dying that “most of the world lives either in denial of death or in terror of it”. Rinpoche describes in his book his first encounter with the death of someone close to him. Particularly with observing the process of their dying and how they as a practiced Buddhist Monk were at peace with this. He decided to devote his life to practicing Buddhism so that he would be more prepared for his own death. These authors discuss how we use materialism and busyness as means of distraction from confronting our mortality. Prior to getting sick I had become lulled by the busyness and relative comfort and stability of my life. Anxiety about mortality was buffered by routine, accumulating wealth, and focus on trivialities such as home renovations.   
Getting sick and staying sick has forced me to confront issues of mortality. During my psychology training I participated in an exercise to help us better empathize with individuals who were dying. We were instructed to write on pieces of paper the names of activities and people that were most dear to us. We then had to close our eyes and gradually drop each of the pages to the floor. This was designed to help us experience the feelings of loss for which the dying must face. 
The experience of chronic illness has reminded me of this exercise. I have had to let go of work, my identity as psychologist, most activities that involved leaving my home such as travel, going to a restaurant, and shopping. My world has become much smaller. I am forced to spend much of my time simply being with myself in my bed. This forced solitude and stillness was initially uncomfortable. When forced to simply be still with yourself, many of us become squirmy. It provides too much space for things we may not want to face to bubble to the surface. It means the distractions of daily life are not available. We must simply be. Being in this situation, aware of my own broken down body, without opportunity for distraction, reminded me of what it must be like towards the end of one’s life. Being in this state led me to contemplate my own mortality.
Because I could not squirm out of it, I had to push past the urge to get away, and had to face the discomfort. This gave me the opportunity to find, particularly with the use of mindfulness, that I became more and more at peace with it. By spending time doing meditations where I tuned in to my body, simply watched my breathing or scanned the sensations throughout my body, I found that I became more and more comfortable with it and with the quietness. The more I let go of the outside world and connected with my own inner experience, the more at peace I felt inhabiting that place. The more I practiced acceptance of whatever experiences or sensations arose the more friendly I felt towards them. Eat pray love sit with self.
 I gradually began to feel that I could accept more and more of what might arise in the future, including my own demise. I thought that when I enter that place at the end when we are all ultimately alone, that will be okay. I find this realization to be a gift. I think this may be what …….meant when he said that “If I am sick and have to lie down that will help me prepare for death”. 
In hearing the stories I many Vietnam Veterans, I have noticed one striking distinction between those who seem to recover and live full lives after the war and those who live as if they are still in the war. The difference is that those who are in a sense still trapped in Vietnam tend to focus on how things should have been different. The government should not have sent them to war. They should have died there. They should have saved their friend. Certain mistakes should not have been made. The country should have responded differently when the returned and so on. Tragedy turned them bitter. Whereas I have encountered others who seem relatively unaffected. When asked how Vietnam affected their life they will say something like “It made me realize life is precious” or “It made me so grateful to have survived”. Instead of rejecting life because of tragedy as many of the former tend to, the latter tends to embrace life because of tragedy. 
I too could get caught up in thoughts about how I should be healthy and how unfair it is to be stuck in bed. But I have learned something from the latter group and try to reflect on how my illness has taught me that life is precious. Things we take for granted can be so easily ripped away. I can choose to focus on the fact that I am alive and there is much to enjoy in spite of my illness. Every day that I wake up and breathe in and out is incredible.
I often have strange and unpleasant occurences in my body besides my typical symptoms. One day I was walking around my neighborhood and felt a sharp pain in my chest whenever I breathed in. I didn’t know what it was, but felt momentarily afraid. I started to catastrophize about what it might be and then, by being mindful, I caught myself doing this and decided to choose a different response. I decided to let the discomfort be there but not focus on it. Instead I chose to focus on all the beauty that was surrounded me on this walk. It was a perfect autumn day. The sky was deep blue, the sun was beaming on my face, and the trees were brilliant shades of red and orange. As I opened up my awareness to take in my entire experience, not just the discomfort in my body, I felt a sense of peace and connection to something much larger than myself. I felt connected to all the beauty around me and as if I was just one small piece of it. I wonder if I felt a sense of the oneness with all of life that is discussed by yogis and Buddhists. At that moment I felt that it did not matter if there was something wrong with me physically. It would be okay if I melted away into nothingness because I was such a small part of all that is. That made me feel peaceful and fearless.  

Chapter Eleven
Control – When do we have it? When do we not?
Serenity Prayer
Maybe move sapoksky, placebo, and Benson here.
Try experimenting with these questions in your own life. Where do you have control? Where do you not? Are there areas where you truly don’t have control and yet keep acting as if you do? These often occurs when we become caught up in patterns of anger. We tend to think others should be more or act more like we think they should. We may try to control their actions. How well does this work out? What effect does it have on our inner peace. (Reference HEAT).
Alternately, are there areas of your life where you feel helpless when you are not? Are there areas that you could change if you were willing to act? Being trapped in a destructive or abusive job or marriage would be one example.
Medical side – ....Acceptance (In delicate balance – warns against seeing therapist who say may have some secondary gain, how to be sick, sick and tired, workbook) vs self-healing (Lisa Ranken says self-sabotating, Herbert bension, diet dad vegan, janet antiimfraatory, tumeric, exercise etc)?
Psychological side – CBT vs ACT
Behaviorists vs nature (HSP, introversion).
Paradox, the middle way, balance – yoga poses as example, 
In Sick and Tired, the authors state that “The person with ICI suffers from a horrible sense of no control. He canot control his illness- it has a course of its own. Exacerbations will come and go. He cannot control his fatigue or his pain. He cannot control his future by planning carefuolly. He can hardly plan next month’s vacation”. 
Feel guilty as if they should be able to control their illness. “Society can intensify this guilt. Populaer books preach a type of control by strong mind and positive attitude”. ….”The seductive message of having control over their illness can doom the chronically ill to a constant quest for a cure with the right diet and exercise, the right answers”. This can lead to hopelessness oand more guilt. 
Mind over medicine, The relaxation response. 
worry as form of controlling physiological arousal and falsely, the future. 
When let go a little and tune in, freak out. 
Stress and somatization seem often lumped together.
I relized in my pursuit for wisdom about loiving with ci, I was running into something that has happened with other major issues I have faced. My tendency to question and see discrepencies was making things complicated. Did children, god. Some people question and probe deeper. Some people don’t think that hard about things and just jump in. they don’t think before having kids. They don’t question whether is a god. They accept whatever diet fad or weird alternative healing method they hear about. 
Learned optimism.
Paradox. 
Zen – think too much. Suicide planes wwii. Jews.
Stress bad and to be avoided, can destroy your body, but can’t avoid. Anxiety – avoidance bad. 
Do chapter on acceptance in the context of mindfulness (kabat zinn, Williams) vs in context of being sick (sick and tired, workbook, toni berhnard?)
Explain difference between acceptance (fully acknowledging what is), letting be (allowing, sitting with, opening), letting go (of control)
One topic that has regularly reared its head throughout the course of my illness is that of control. Trying to sort out where I had it and where I did not has been quite baffling and at times painful. Those who write on the topic of illness often seem to emphasize one side or the other. I’ve noticed writers who are themselves struggling with chronic illness tend to highlight the topic of acceptance, that is, a sort of making peace with one’s illness instead of being at war with it. I think this comes from the wisdom of personal experience. (provide quote)
By contrast, other writers such as Herbert Benson emphasize a sense of personal control over illness via the message that self-healing is possible through the mind-body connection. Benson writes what sounds like an impressive promise, “”. 
Jon Kabat-Zinn writes about the Seligman research which found that people with an optimistic attitude towards life and their illness had better health outcomes. This optimistic attitude involves three key parts. The first is a tendency when life throws challenges one’s way to not blame oneself for them. The second is a tendency to see problems as limited in scope. The third is a tendency to assume problems will be short lived and not permanent. By contrast, pessimists tend to interpret problems such as developing illness and their fault, pervasive in its effects on their lives, and permanent.…… He also highlights the research of Albert Bandura which found that “a strong sense of self-efficacy is the best and most consistent predictor of positive health outcomes in many different medical situations”. Self-efficacy is the belief that one can control over the events in their life. However, also emphasizes something that I think is important. …..
Gorski writes that….
When I have read writings about personal control over illness, such as Benson’s about the powerful placebo, it has stirred up tremendous anxiety for me. This is because I then begin to start digging around into such questions as “did I somehow make myself sick with my attitude?” and “what am I doing wrong that is keeping me sick?” and “would I get well if I could just somehow relax enough or sufficiently believe that I am going to get better?”. His recommendation to spend time daily visualizing one’s life as it was when one was well seems to clash with the value I have experienced in accepting the moment as it is. I did give his technique a whirl for a while and found it depressing to focus on what was which meant dwelling on what I have lost. Yet his writing is so emphatic about the benefits I should receive from his method that it made me begin to feel that there was this carrot somehow just out of my reach because I just cannot twist my thinking into a place where I believe that I can make myself well. I do think that learning to relax can help me heal, but there are not guarantees. I may or may not get well despite my best efforts to control my mind/body. To me this seems like it is realistic and not delusional.  When I read his writing, all the old anxiety about my illness that I felt before I began learning a mindful and acceptance approach resurfaced.  
Funnily, as I write this I worry that my reflection on the subject may hinder someone else’s path. I am reminded of how I was taken aside following Bible Study in preparation for baptism at age 14 and told to stop asking so many questions as it could harm the faith of the others in the group. 
I had to learn to hold the tension between control and letting go of control. As is highlighted throughout this book, I benefitted from letting go of control in many areas including trying to control the sensations that accompany my symptoms which only made them more distressing. I had to let go of trying to find answers such as in the form of a clear diagnosis and explanation for why this had happened. I had to let go of control of the image others have of me knowing it may be distorted or shaped by their own biases and agenda. I had to let go of my career and its comfortable salary. I had to let go of my identity as a practicing Psychologist. I had to let go of the daily sense of deep meaning and purpose I gained from working with Veterans. Yet all this letting go, or acceptance, did not mean giving up. It meant accepting reality as it is with a sense of openness, not with resistance or hopelessness. I had to learn to embrace my new normal and I found that this was not a terrible life, just a different life. 
I had to learn where I still have control and to be actively engaged with these aspects of my life. They include such areas as monitoring my activities and energy levels and my mood. I had to get creative and proactive about finding activities I could do within my current limitations and to know how much and how little to do depending on my fatigue. I had to pay attention with mindful awareness to when I was becoming bored or overly sedentary and know this was the time to do something different and/or more active. All this is done to balance my energy levels with my need to engage in pleasurable activities in order to hold depression at bay. I also learned it is ok to feel emotions like anxiety and depression without jumping in to fix them. However, I also had to learn to not feed them with catastrophizing or negative thoughts. I had to balance doing my best to minimize my symptoms such as through healthy living while also not becoming obsessive or self-recriminating about it. I had to balance problem solving with don’t know mind. I had to know when to attend to new symptoms and go see my doctor and when to simply watch physical sensations come and go. I had maintain openness that new helpful treatments may come along and to explore my options without getting sucked in false claims about the control I can have over my health made by quacks. I had to hold both the reality that my symptoms have not gone away and may not go away with the possibility that anything can happen at any time and thus I may get better one day.  
Thus there is a tension to be held between surrender and engagement, between being mode and doing mode when it comes to chronic illness.  This tight rope act draws to mind Marsha Linehan’s writings on dialectics …… There is no perfect balance to be found between these opposing forces, but instead and ongoing, dynamic process of moving back and forth between them. It also draws to mind Pema Chodron’s teachings on groundlessness. I can hold the tension between these opposites by not clinging to solid ground. By recognizing that life is in flux, always changing, not certain or predictable. I can relax into this and keep dancing with life that includes chronic illness.  
Learning how to let go of control has been a more significant and poignant role in my process. This may be in part because it comes naturally to me as it does for many of us to strive for control. Self-efficacy (Bandura) comes naturally to me and contributed to my obtaining a Ph.D. I tend to believe I can accomplish things I set my mind to. I have tended to assume my illness is not really chronic and will resolve at any moment. However, whenever I have applied this same approach since becoming ill, I have inevitably become sicker. For example, while still working, whenever I felt the slightest improvement in symptoms I took this to mean I was cured and should increase my work hours and get on with life as it was.   
I have spent some time experimenting with step two of Benson’s protocol, the part that involves visualizing what it was like when I was healthy. What this tends to do for me is stir up feelings of overconfidence and a strong desire for reality to be other than what it is returns. I then find myself wanting to behave as if I am not sick and wholeheartedly throw myself back into life. This is what happened repeatedly when I was still working and had periods where I felt better. I immediately jumped to the conclusion that I was well and began filling up my life with the busy activities of the past. Every time this happened, my health would then deteriorate again. Benson’s approach reminds me of John Henryism, it also makes me think of the woman with cancer who believed she could make herself well and gave up cancer treatment. Benson does not recommend foregoing traditional medicine; however he also does not amply address the potential downside of his recommendations if they are taken to mean more than I think he means them to. After spending time doing step two I also then experience a bout of mild depression as I have to once again come to terms with the fact that I cannot do all the things I want to do. I find myself then turning back to the acceptance models and easing back into a place of peace. He reminds me of a bull in a china shop when it comes to his chapters on treating anxiety and depression.
I am sure that the Benson approach would be a good fit for some people with particular ailments; however it is not a good fit for me and my particular health situation. While Benson emphasizes the value of the healing power of the health care professional giving you sugar pills and telling you that you will get well, I think it is best to experiment and finds what works for you recognizing that this will vary from person to person.    
What of the personality types that are naturally optimistic and who gravitates to the self-healing movement? Is there a dark side to their style?
Within the topic of health there seems to me to be two at times clashing voices. One is the voice of the self-healing movement. These are individuals who profess that “You can heal yourself!” Some emphasize diet, others exercise, and others strongly emphasize the power of your mind over your body. There is another voice that emerges within the chronic illness literature. This voice seems a little softer and gentler to me. It emphasizes the power of acceptance. It says “You are sick and that is okay”. These two are not mutually exclusive. Most who emphasize the former would typically not say all illness is curable via such things as diet or your positive beliefs/attitude (thought there are some extremists on this side).  Those who emphasize the role of acceptance would not say to passively approach illness and ignore such things as diet and attitude. What seems truly different to me is the emphasize on control. Those within the self-healing movement seem very focused on trying to control illness. Those from within the acceptance-based approach tend to be more concerned with acknowledging that there is much we cannot control and finding peace with that. It reminds me of the Alcoholic’s Anonymous quotation “God, grant me the courage to change …….” With illness, I think it makes sense to control what you can and accept what you cannot. What else can you do? But determining to what extent we have control appears to be up for debate at this time. Those from within the self-healing movement seem to think we have a lot of control. Those from within the acceptance movement tend to acknowledge that there is a dark side to all that emphasis on control. I imagine different people will be drawn more to one approach than the other. Personalities drawn to optimism, happy endings, and control might prefer the message of the self-healing movement. Personalities such as mine who are more skeptical in nature and also prefer to fully embrace reality versus using positive spin to cope may prefer the acceptance-based approach. There are some writers who seem to bridge the two well such as ….who writes that she pursued mind-body approaches to self-healing. She acknowledges that for some this approaches may bring about actual physical healing but for others the benefit may be that they learn to find joy in the midst of illness.  
For me, the idea of letting go of some control, and surrendering to the reality that bad things happen, and also that that is okay is profoundly helpful. Opening to the reality that there is much that much can go wrong in life and life is still wonderful, for me brings a sense of peace and contentedness. This is to me the opposite of burying your head in the sand. For me personally this has meant acknowledging that I am sick and that is okay. But what has surprised me is to find that this way of thinking is quite off putting to some. I have noticed others in my life seem to recoil when I discuss it. I have come to find that this is viewed by some as not realistic, but pessimistic. For them it is truly not okay that I am sick. It feels at times as if they think my acknowledgment of it is keeping me sick. For them it seems that acceptance equals giving up and/or actively avoiding attainable cures. They make statements such as “We need to figure out how to fix you” and “That is so depressing”.  They seem to believe that illness is always something to be overcome and that if you cannot overcome it you must be choosing it. I think that anyone who struggles with chronic illness can tell you, they did not choose it. But those who are well want to believe they have control over their own health so they comfort themselves by saying, you must be ill because of something you are doing. 
One family member read Toni Berhnard’s “How to Be Sick” after I stated how much it had helped me. Whereas for me the book was immensely uplifting, their response was “I hope you aren’t as sick as she is”. This was somewhat deflating for me because I think my situation is similar to hers and my take away from the book was, “She is as sick as I am and is also okay!” This person had clearly not been hearing me when I had described to them how sick I was. They had somehow tuned this out.   
Many of us who are sick struggle with feeling viewed by others as emotionally weak in addition to physically weak. Those who are pillars of physical health are often assumed to be also emotionally strong. These are assumptions that may be true in some cases, but in general I see it differently. After struggling with illness myself I have come to view the sick as a tough lot. The books I have read written by the chronically ill tell stories of bravery. Personally, in spite of all I have been through and what I must face daily, I persevere. I have adapted. I am okay. I even feel content and joyful much of the time. I have found a way to enjoy life in spite of significant limitations. I think this takes strength. I now see those who live with chronic illness and still move forward with their lives as powerfully strong people. It takes guts and gumption to do so. It takes fortitude to get up and make dinner when it must be done but your body feels like it has been run over by a truck. It also takes courage to be honest about your limitations and say “No, I can’t do that” in spite of pressures both from outside and inside of ourselves to deny those limitations. Those of us who are sick with chronic illnesses have stared awful and frightening experiences in the face and have lived to tell about it. We have not given up or crumbled under the weight of it. This tells us something about ourselves. 
It is often assumed that there is something about our character that has caused our illness. I think this is something that the healthy comfort themselves with at times. It may help them feel protected against our fate. But much of the time I think getting a chronic illness has a lot to do with luck. It just happens to some of us. Sickness often just happens and there is no comforting explanation for why. Certainly genes and lifestyle factors play a role, but sometimes those who do everything right still get sick. Those who are healthy may be that way in large part due to good luck. Thus, we should not see them as superior to us. We may even have something beneficial. Those who have never struggled with significant physical limitations do not know how they would cope if they became ill. Those of us who are ill are on the other side of this and have the comfort of knowing we can cope. Losing one’s health and ultimately losing one’s life are factors that terrify many. Once one has lost their health, they can begin to move past that terror and into a new realm. That is a realm where one has faced and potentially come to accept the reality of human frailty without denial or terror and in spite of it continue to live and love life. Regarding the ultimate fear, that of one’s mortality, living with chronic illness gives you the opportunity to come to terms with this inevitability possible sooner than for others. When your illusions about your invincibility crumble under the weight of illness, you can begin to open to a new way of living. One that allows you to hold the reality of your mortality with a little less trepidation. Now that I view life through the lens of illness I have noticed such a strong message from others and from society that illness is not okay. That health is necessary for happiness. There seems to be a frantic quality to this message at times. Those who are healthy often seem truly terrified of the possibility of circumstances such as mine. I think health is nice, but not necessary for happiness. It certainly makes it easier to be happy, but joy is still possible from within the midst of flawed and limited circumstances. Ultimately, all of our bodies will fail us. Chronic illness gives one the opportunity to practice dealing with this sooner. Buddhist saying helps prepare for death.     
This is not to say I think the current emphasis on taking personal responsibility for one’s health is a bad thing. By all means, eat better, exercise, manage stress. Do what you can to avoid the avoidable illnesses. But it is also okay to acknowledge that in the words of Jack Kornfield? “Anything can happen at anytime”. The control we have over our health has limits and that is okay. 
Within the trauma literature there is a concept called post-traumatic growth. 
I recently read the book “Wild” about a young woman who is devastated by the loss of her mother and out of desperation to try and heal she decides to hike the Pacific Coast trail alone. At one point she says, she is able to tackle this enormous challenge and all the frightening situations she must face because the worst thing has already happened. Her mother died. This terribly loss has also freed her from the need to avoid frightening things.
The other night I had a flare up of symptoms, particularly fatigue and brain fog. It may have been due to walking my dog that morning when it was particularly hot and humid. But as is often the case, I can’t be sure. My husband first noticed it as I wasn’t being as responsive as usual to his comments about his day. I tried to rally, but felt as if cob webs has filled my brain and were blocking my neurons from firing properly. My body felt caked in cement. When this comes on after a period of feeling a bit better, it can initially be scary. Old tapes kick in such as “Oh no” and “What is happening?” and “I don’t want this to be happening” and “What if it is the beginning of a new and particularly terrible period”. But with experience and practice, I have become more quickly able to observe secondary suffering as it is happening and make a choice to respond differently. I had to work at it, but gradually became able to open to the fuzziness, the heaviness simply as they were, nothing added. I just said to myself, just let go and let it be and I did. The next day I felt better.
