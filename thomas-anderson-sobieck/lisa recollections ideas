Happiest moments:
Came out of the room second time - on valentines day
IHOP
Tea parties
Collecting tea stuff, after room the first time
While I was working at my last job I remember telling people about how amazing it was to see lisa so happy. She was sitting on her swinging porch with the dog. She did this all day when the weather was nice
We'd have tea parties every morning before I went to work. Just a fancy table cloth, some of her beautiful collection of tea stuff, and some black tea. For a while there we were also reading the stoics. 
Meeting her at Top 10 Wines. Then when we became a thing. 

First retired
    Working on book, table in the sun room - find book
    Laying in bed watching tv all day, south facing room, sun streaming in, Zoe on the bed

Almost 10 years exactly this ending. Zoe died, we got Gidget, had a few months of happiness
    Zoe's memorial internet domain lapsed just a few days ago after 10 years


Birthday Party with whole family at Abigailâ€™s in rocheport.

Mom making me angel food cake, negative

Going to Chuckie Cheese on my first day of work. So happy! Find Photo

Came downstairs for the first time and looked at the mess of our yard and was so upset, funny 

Very proud of what I did for her
