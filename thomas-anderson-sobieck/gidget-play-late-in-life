Gidget keeps just looking at me. She normally is asleep on her heating pads. But I think she is waiting to go great her mommy. Every day even on the worst days Gidget would stand on Lisa’s bed and they would greet each other. On bad months it would be Gidgets only real interaction with Lisa. But she would waggle her little tail and put her head on the mattress while making little happy growling noises as Lisa talked to her. 

When Lisa was doing better recently we would go into the living room and play with Gidget. Gidget would stand on the couch and play bite us while Lisa raved her up. Then I’d ask Gidget if wanted to play ball and she would race to the front yard and I would throw the ball for her. But Gidget refused to play ball (her favorite activity besides eating and being close to us) unless Lisa was somehow involved. We went maybe six months not doing that. Recently Lisa was able to do that for maybe three months.
