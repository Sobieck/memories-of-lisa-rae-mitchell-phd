Vivid dreams of Lisa. I cried and told her I missed her, loved her, and wanted her back. 

Ate my banana and PB. Planned on what I'm eating. Making Lentil and Lemon soup and BLTs with fake bacon. 

Went on a bike ride to the new Perche Creek Spur just for the heck of it when I woke up. Gidget isn't getting walked until 8:30 with robyn and I wanted to go enjoy the relative cool (high seventies).
