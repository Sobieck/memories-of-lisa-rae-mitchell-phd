Woke up at five. Slept pretty well.

Ate banana with PB. Drank a coffee in prep for my run. Brushed my teeth. Went running. Seven miles. Slow. Cried a bit on the run. I think I decided to take an amtrak up to chicago. I want to eat some good food, swim in michigan, and visit some museums and aquariums with Gidget. I think I'll stay at an upscale hotel. 

I took the pup on a walk. We went quite a bit further that normal. One of the people that commented on Gidget's cuteness today was a giant totally shredded dude. Gidget was in her pink dog purse. He yelled "I love your dog" as we passed each other. I said "I do too!" He was wearing an enormous backpack with Army written on it. 

I got home, made Gidget some eggs which she turned her nose up at. I ate the rest of them. 

My parents came before I was even able to get out of my walking linens. I helped my pop load the car with more stuff for goodwill and moved all the vases into the garage for Emily. I took a shower and brushed my teeth. This was stupid given that I was helping load the car again in just a few minutes. Oh well. 

The roomba that was too loud for lisa is cleaning the house. I remember when I got it I thought I'd solved the cleaning problem because it was supposedly quiet. But it really hurt Lisa even when she was upstairs.
