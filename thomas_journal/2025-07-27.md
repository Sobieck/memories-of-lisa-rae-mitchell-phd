Woke up at around 5:30. We went on a nice walk. Came home and cleaned the garage and basement. The dumpster is already full. 

Tried to make french toast, used the really big pan and it didn't work out. Took a shower. Ate some take out food. Finished up andor. 

Going to see the mitchells soon. 

It is very weird not being part of a couple. I met Lisa in my early twenties. She would tell me how lucky I was to meet her so early in my life, because she was 10 years older than me and knew how bad dating was. I really was lucky to find her when I did. But pretty much my entire adult life I had someone I knew to my core that I could count on. Not having that now is unsettling. 

Worked on this thing a bit. 

I think I might go look for easy recipes to make and get some groceries. I'm sick of ordering out.
