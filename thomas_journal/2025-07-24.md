I woke up at 5:30ish. Then I took the dog our real quick and then explored the trail with my new bike. 

On that trip I went down the newly opened spur. It is paved and there were wetlands on either side of the trail and lots of flowers. Then I got to about the half way point of the trip to rocheport. And then I came home. I was concerned because I used up about half the battery which isn't good. 

I got home, and the trash bin had been delivered. So I started to clear out my garage of the stuff we cleared from the two living floors of my house. Some glass fell on the street when I was doing that :(. 

Gidget and I then had a nice walk with Robyn. We talked about all sorts of things. Ray might be rending a bike soon. We talked about Lisa a bit. We talked about how I'm a bit afraid of not having anyone around in case an accident happens to me. She also talked about how she was worried about their stuff. I should have let her know now that I don't have Lisa she has me to rely on and I'm pretty dependable. 

I then came home and finished up the first part of the garage job. I think I'm going to have to get them to clear the bin before I'm done which will double the cost. Oh well. I guess I don't have a typical situation. 

I came inside and showered. I ordered some Egg McSandwiches. The last time I had those was the day I got so sick when I was caring for Lisa. I stopped eating take out after that and thought that I'd never eat another Egg McSandwich. 

I then went on another ride on the bike to see if going to Rocheport was actually doable. And I made it 33% of the way there while using very little juice. I just need to rely on my peddles a bit more and use the electric motor more to get up to speed and to occasionally take a break. 

Gidget did not like being left alone, but I need another part for her carrying cage. It should be here soonish and then we won't have to use our car as much.
