Woke up a little before 5. Ate my banana and PB.

Cleaned the basement for a couple hours. I think I'll be done with it in about 10 days. I could probably be done in like 3 days if I really applied myself but I don't want to. 

Went on a nice long walk with Robyn. It is a lot cooler today so Gidget dog did really well. 

Made lentil, coriander, cumin and lemon soup. I added the salad greens that I had leftover from my BLTs. It turned out really well. I put a bit too much salt in it but it didn't ruin it. 

Played a single player game for the first time since Lisa killed herself. I picked up Palworld and I am enjoying playing it. It is nice to have something to occupy myself and I enjoy the solitude. I was just listening to music while it played.

Made plans with Dan. He is going to come over for lunch and then take my car and service it sometime early next week. 

Sat outside for a couple hours with the dog. She really likes the weather. 

Tried to remember all the meals I've made myself since Lisa's death. So I can remember different things I can make.

I will be going to bed early again tonight.
