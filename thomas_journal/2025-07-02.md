woke up at around 5:10. Stayed in bed until 6ish. I guess I'm sleeping well. 

Took Gidget dog on a walk. 2 people stopped me to tell her how cute she was. 

Made some eggs for the pup, she didn't eat :(

Took a shower, unloaded the dishwasher. 

Sitting down to write now

Mary claire called and apologized about the fucked up thing she told me 5 or so months before Lisa died. This is nice. I was still extremely angry with her but I am not now.

Ma and pop came over to help. 

I went through pictures and gave them to different folk

Ate fruit with pop, dan came over to say high, same with mark

Went to the mitchells house. Gave them an elephant pot and a bunch of photos. 

Made gidgets food, cut her treats
