woke up at four. Laid in bed until 5:50. Ate some banana and pb. 

Walked the pup. I think I saw a beaver in the creek! It could have been a nutria though. But I'm pretty sure its tail was big and flat so I'm thinking beaver.

Took shower. 

I'm planning on heading to petco or petsmart to buy a dog carrying luggage for the trip. I think I might go to the electric bike shop too. I'm pretty sure I'll buy an e-bike as my primary means of transport in Columbia. I'll put a dog holder on the front of it.

Worked on this a bit. I have a big backlog of things I want to write down.
