Woke up at four. I think I slept well. 

Cleaned out the garage. By the time that was done it was light enough to clean up the backyard. Cleaned all that up. I’m lucky I put one of the hose storage things in the wheel barrel because when I threw it in the bin an enormous amount of wasps came out of it pissed off. I’m glad that wasn’t in the cab of the car with me. My pop came over to shop vac the garage shelves. He did a great job. My ma suggested I throw away the rugs so I also did that. Took the dog on a walk in there. But I’m all done throwing stuff away now at 9:50. Tomorrow I start sweeping and vacuuming the basement. 

Now I’m waiting on the insurance guy to look at the roof and siding. I’m going to have him look at the erosion too. 

Finished The Fire Next Time by Baldwin. It was great. A wonderful articulation of solidarity. Started Native Son by him.

The insurance adjuster got her right now time which was nice. 

I think I'm going to bike to cafe poland for lunch today. Get a plate of pierogis and a salad.
