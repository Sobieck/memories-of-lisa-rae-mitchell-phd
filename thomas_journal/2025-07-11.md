Woke up at 3:30. The moon was bright as fuck and shining right in my eyes. I think it would have been fine normally but I was supposed to meet Mal at 7 for a little run. So it freaked me out that I missed the run. So I've been up since then. Got out of bed at 5.

Took Gidget on a walk but she wasn’t up for it. I'd just set her down and she'd just stand there. Then I went on a run but my leg was not working with me so I had to cancel. I think we are going to stop running until we are in Chicago. I think I will try to keep walking with gidget but maybe not if her lethargy keeps going

Worked on this a bit

I think not believing in god is particularly useful for me these days. If I was a believer I would be unbelievable pissed that they tortured my love for so long. At least this way it is just bad luck.

Ate some fruit

Watched Bourdain, then went through all of Chicago’s Michelin stars and figured out which ones had takeout.

Read with the pup for a while

Packed. One roller on my back is squared off so it makes a loud noise every rotation as my stuff is jostled. Not getting a new bag though. That is for sure.
