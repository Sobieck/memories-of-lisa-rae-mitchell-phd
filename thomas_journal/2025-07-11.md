Woke up at 3:30. The moon was bright as fuck and shining right in my eyes. I think it would have been fine normally but I was supposed to meet Mal at 7 for a little run. So it freaked me out that I missed the run. So I've been up since then. Got out of bed at 5.

Took Gidget on a walk but she wasnâ€™t up for it. I'd just set her down and she'd just stand there. Then I went on a run but my leg was not working with me so I had to cancel. I think we are going to stop running until we are in Chicago. I think I will try to keep walking with gidget but maybe not if her lethargy keeps going

Worked on this a bit
