Woke up at five. Thought I was going to be up for the rest of the day at 1:30 but I think I went right back to sleep.

Trying to recover data from a busted hard disk.

Sending a new email to cleaner. 

Wrote a little.

I was looking at hotels in Chicago a couple days ago and I came across the hotel that I wanted to take Lisa to when she was feeling better. The hotel had high tea which Lisa would have loved. The idea would be that we'd fly into chicago from Columbia. It would have been an easy flight. So many dreams unfulfilled.

I need to get into the habit of talking to the dog and turning on lights. It is raining really hard and I'm sitting in front of my computer without lights on. I bet it would be more pleasant in here with lights on.

Did the 2016 photo review. I need to go add some of the photos to my stories. But I can't. Looking at her in that year really fucked me up. It was such a hard and wonderful year all at the same time. The first part of the year was horrible with Lisa going into the hospital suicidal with pain. Then the dark room. Then the incredible joy of her being out of the room. I wish she'd never tried botox. I wish we'd just gone on with our life as it was, it wasn't perfect but it was ok.
