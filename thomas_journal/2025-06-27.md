woke up to the sounds of thunder and flashes of lightning. I had a panic attack because I didn't wake up lisa to put on her mask before it hit. Now I'm just crushed because my lovey is gone. 

My adrenaline was still going so I thought maybe food might make me sleepy. Went downstairs and had spicy olives. Realized that running a mostly empty dishwasher each day is stupid so I went to the basement to get more of the glass leftover containers I feed Gidget in. So now I’ll be able to go five days between washes at maximum. Brushed my teeth, now it’s time to try to go to sleep.
