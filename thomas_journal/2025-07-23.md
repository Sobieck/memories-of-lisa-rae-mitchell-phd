Woke up at six today. Had a real hard time getting to sleep last night.

Ate a banana a peanut butter. Took the trash out. Took the dog on a walk. 

The walk was lovely. Hotter than I like. But the sun was shinning through the canopy and everything had a beautiful glow. 

A woman joked that she would love to take my dog. 

Came home and ate some blue berries and cherries. 

Took shower

Ate ramen

Visited the mitchells 

Got my meshtastic antenna. Disappointed to learn that I'm not in a hotbed of meshtastic activity. 

My bike came. I put the bike itself together. Got the tires aired up. Rode it a bit. Got the automatic gear changing set up. Rode it some more. 

Just sort of sat around. I didn't watch andor today. I think I might be over TV for a bit. 

Ate some ethopian food. 

I need to ask my neighbors to borrow a wheelbarrow but I'm stalling because I really don't want to talk to people today. 

Itâ€™s very weird not having to worry about every little thing. I just caught myself reflexively checking to see if my phone was muted. For years and years and years I had to ask myself constantly if x thing would cause Lisa pain. The levels of stress this caused was astronomical on both of us.
