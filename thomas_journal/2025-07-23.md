Woke up at six today. Had a real hard time getting to sleep last night.

Ate a banana a peanut butter. Took the trash out. Took the dog on a walk. 

The walk was lovely. Hotter than I like. But the sun was shinning through the canopy and everything had a beautiful glow. 

A woman joked that she would love to take my dog. 

Came home and ate some blue berries and cherries.
