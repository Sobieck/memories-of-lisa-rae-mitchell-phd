Woke up at 5:20ish. Slept well. Gidget made a big noise in the middle of the night. I'm guessing it was mouth pain but I told her it would be ok and she went back to sleep.

I've been having bananas with pb every morning right when I wake up. It is a nice little breakfast snack before Gidget and I do our walk.

I've been transporting gidget in her travel cage (it is soft and pink. Very cute) to get her used to it. She whimpered a little today when we went to the trail. But she was quiet by the time we made it there (like a 30 second drive). 

Gidget walked very well on the trail this morning. I felt a little bit bad about having a short one. I'm still in a tiny amount of pain with my left leg. I hope it is completely gone by Tuesday so I don't have to worry about it in Chicago. I'd also like to run every other day I'm there. 

I got a omelet from Big Mama's Place. I've never had food from this place but I don't feel like cooking and a veggie omelet sounded good for both me and the pup. I have given up on veganism for the time being. I will get back to it when I get home from the trip. I originally abandoned it because I was trying to get my grieving little pup to eat. But I have just lost the motivation and eating eggs and the like is just so much easier. And I'm not going to bother with it because my eating options in Chicago are limited by the pup, so I don't want a further constraint. 

The plan for today it to finalize getting ready for my trip and trying to relax. I'm worried about the trip since I haven't been out of the house is six years. Emily is also going to come over briefly and I'm going to go over to the mitchells for a bit. Oh and I play games tonight.
