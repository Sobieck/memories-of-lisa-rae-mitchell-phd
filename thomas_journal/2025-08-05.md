I had real trouble sleeping last night. I think I got 4 hours of sleep. I woke up thinking about what I needed to do in the basement today. So I woke at 4ish and got to work. I think I have a day's worth of work down there, but it will be split over two days. Tomorrow I'm bringing up the rest of the furniture, the next day (after the bin is emptied) I'm going to put the heavy ass king mattress in the bin along with whatever else junk I have down there. Then I just need to finish up the garage and outdoors situation.

After I did all that, Gidget and I biked down to the trail and took her on a walk. The bike was real easy and it will prevent me doing stupid little 1 mile long drives with the car. I'm thrilled. 

Then I took a shower. 

I made a spinach, chili powder, sherry, chickpea, tomato, and thyme soup. It is outstanding. 

I helped Dan bring some junk to my bin. He let me borrow his shop vac. He recommended Swift Construction for my remodel. He said batteries plus takes old batteries. 

Ted Weber came over. He likes the house and he gave me a lot of recommendations on what to change.

He said I could call for any sort of advice. 

Laid on the couch because I was so tired. Fell asleep for an hour. Woke right before I went to dinner.

Had dinner outside on the patio at Flyover with the inlaws and parents. It was really nice. I came home ready to tell Lisa that the conversations were nice even without meticulous planning but then I remembered she was gone. The food was also very good (but not up to Gidget's standards unfortunately. I guess she goes hungry tonight). 

Going to bed early tonight. I really want to just lay there for a few hours (this is untrue. I hope I sleep).
