I had a really really hard time getting to sleep last night. I don't think I was asleep until 1am. I was thinking it might be from the seven mile run but now it is occurring to me that it might be from the description of Lisa's death. 

I woke up at five thirty ish and started cleaning the basement. I did that for quite a while, I have the bin 3/4 full now! I got the giant broken freezer out somehow with a dolly and when it fell over on the hill, lifting it upright and then pushing it over multiple times until I got it in a good position. It is cool out but that really wore me out. It was heavy as hell. Pop came over at around 8 to help load the car and throw things in the bin. We then went on a walk with Gidget and I finally took a shower at 10. 

I'm going to eat some gluten free penne with fake cultured butter and parm. Then I'm going to head over to see the mitchells. 

The other main thing on my to-do list today is fill out either the paperwork for OPM or Lisa's insurance. It's funny that I have all this shit to do exactly when I get interested in playing games. Oh well. Games will have to wait until later today. And I'm not all that excited about Palworld (or probably any game to tell you the truth) so it isn't that big of a deal. It is nice to get all this stuff off my plate.
