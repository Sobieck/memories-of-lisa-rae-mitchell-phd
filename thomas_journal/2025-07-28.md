woke up at five thirty, took the dog out on her walk, ran six miles, met Mal for a mile or so of that 

Did some cleaning (the bin is completely full now)

Ate some breakfast burritos

Took a shower

Called the real estate agent, filed a claim for my insurance for my roof, called the trash folk to pick up the bin

The real estate agent is coming over tomorrow at 1. I just want to ask him about the high ROI renovations. I'm not planning on leaving now but I might. 

Went over to the mitchells, then I went over to see Mary Claire. I'm socialed out which is great because I'm bringing Mal and her partner food tomorrow.

Ate some mexican food and it is somehow already one thirty. 

Tomorrow I'm taking an enforced break from doing the clean out since they can't empty the bin until tomorrow.
