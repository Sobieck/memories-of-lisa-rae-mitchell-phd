Woke up at 4. Laid in bed for a bit. On waking, I was thinking about how we were going to get Lisa back to feeling better. The problem with death is that it is the end of possibilities. I wish she would have waited. 

Ate a banana with pb. Brushed teeths.

Took the pup on a walk at dawn.

Went running at 6:30. Met Mal for a mile or so. It was nice talking with her. Ran a total of 6 miles.

Came home and made burritos for the pup and me. 

Showered. Brushed teeth.
