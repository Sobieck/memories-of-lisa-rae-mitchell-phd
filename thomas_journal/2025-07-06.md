Woke up at 4ish. Laid in bed until five. Took Gidget on an early morning walk. It occurred to me that Lisa and I lived near that trail our entire relationship. It is kind of a through line in our lives. 

I ran with Mal for a bit on the trail. It was supposed to be an off day so I took it easy. I'll be skipping tomorrow run. 

I plan on seeing the parents off today, and then I'm going to try to just chill and not talk to basically anyone all day. I need rest. I do have to play games tonight though.
