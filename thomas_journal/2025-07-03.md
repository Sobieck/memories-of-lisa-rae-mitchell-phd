Woke up at 3:30. 

Thoughts that are keeping me awake

Thinking about the way she died 

Thinking about how I told her that she needed to be trying treatment. I think the deal I told her is that she needed to at least be trying to find a treatment or caregiving because I needed her to feel better or me be able to have a break. She was liable to just sit for the rest of her life and I wanted her get better. Maybe I applied too much pressure by saying that? There wasnâ€™t a deadline or anything. She just needed a plan and hope. 

There goes thinking about how she died again.

Ate some banana with peanut butter. Ran six miles, but maybe a quarter mile of that was walking. Disappointing run. I think it might have been hotter this morning because I was struggling.

Made Gidget some scrambled eggs. 

Working on writing down some stories.
