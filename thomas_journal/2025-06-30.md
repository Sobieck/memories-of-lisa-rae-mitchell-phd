I slept wellish. Was up at midnight for a bit. Slept until 4:30. Pretty good night.

Today was a running day, but my parents threw away my Body Glide that keeps the inner thigh chaffing away in this heat. I was really looking forward to my run. I hate it, but it really became the only thing that was fully mine over the past few years. Lisa simply could not call me for help while I was running (I think she only needed me once in all those years). So it was the only time I could let my guard down and be me. So I thought, I need something to reduce friction in my swimsuit area. What do I have? And then I remembered that we had some lube! We hadn't had sex in probably ten years because physical touch tended to hurt Lisa even that long ago. So I got out the very old lube and put it on. It was a good thought but unfortunately it didn't work. Within a half a mile there was friction. I don't want to chaff so I stopped and walked home. Oh well. I'll run tomorrow after the Body Glide comes (highly endorse, works miracles). 

Gidget and I went on a walk right after that. We tried a new route and she did OK! I'm going to keep getting her used to new routes because I don't think we will be staying here. So she needs to generalize her ability to walk on that one route. 

mr. Pham called me needing me to print something for him, which I did.

I ate some morningstar farms corn dogs. I think they are just as good as meat corn dogs. Very tasty. 

Sarah sent me a nice note about survivors guilt. 

Mary wants the books that Lisa referenced in her book. 

Now I'm showering.
