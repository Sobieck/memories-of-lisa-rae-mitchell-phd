Woke up at five. I'm sleeping better than I was. I'm not getting enough though. I dreamt of Lisa last night. She was needing me for something but I don't remember what it was. 

Had some banana and peanut butter

Went on a longer walk with Gidget in a new area of our walk to get her used to walking other places. We walked a pretty far way around the pond that is near the dog park. She is doing really good with the novel walks. 

Came home and tried to get Gidget to eat. I put her rabies vaccine tag on her harness. 

Took a shower, brushed my teeth for the second time today.

I was invited to a movie night with a couple of my mastodon friends. That is nice. 

I got through the 2014 photos but barely. I've been crying while doing it. Lisa would always tell me that period of her life was her favorite. She was very sick but not so sick that it destroyed her ability to enjoy things. We couldn't do most things that normal people do, but we've always loved the little things. She also just loved that we were together all the time. She'd do her things and I'd do mine, but we could interact with each other any time we wanted. She would always talk longingly at the end of her life about just wanting to be able to lay down and read or watch tv. The last 5 or so years of her life she laying down just hurt unless it was for bed, and then she'd lay down in a way that was uncomfortable for her. She was a tummy sleeper during her healthy period of her life (we bonded over this as I am also a tummy sleeper), but only sleeping on her back was doable by the end. 

The 4th of July used to be my favorite holiday. I'd normally be in michigan at the lake house and spend it in Lake Michigan. BBQ and the lake were just magically. I also believed in what America stood for. I still believe in America's stated values. All people are valuable, migrants should be welcomed with open arms and are our strength, etc. Today I'm just treating it like any other day. Maybe next year I'll be at a place where I can go enjoy the beach or whatever. 

I'm going to go eat some peanuts and wait for my parents to get here.
