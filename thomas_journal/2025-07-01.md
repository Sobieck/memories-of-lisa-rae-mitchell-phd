Woke up around 4ish? Just stayed in bed until 5:30. It seems like my sleep is getting a lot better. 

Went on a six mile run. Saw Jeff and told him that Lisa is dead. "hi, my wife is dead" is a great conversation starter. 

When I got home I made Gidget some scrambled eggs, and figured I should have some as well. Gidget ate pretty dang good.

I then rearranged where I have my dirty cloths, running stuff, and cold weather stuff. 

I'm now sitting down to write a little. At 8:30 I'm meeting Robyn at the trail for our first walk since Lisa's death. It is going to be weird.

I need to get back to talking. I used to always talk all the time because I was trying to cheer up Lisa. Just talking bullshit you know? But I think Gidget misses it because I always used to talk to her.
