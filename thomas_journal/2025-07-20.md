Sick. Up a lot last night. Very lucky I’m not traveling. Tummy issues. Probably ate something not good. 

I don’t know how I cared for Lisa when I was feeling like this that one time. Fuck that is wild that I did that.

Gidget is under the covers snuggling with me. She doesn’t do that often. She might be picking up on my not feeling well.

Gidget is upset by the lack of action. Aren’t we going to do something today?!

Gidget and I have cuddled a lot today 

I’m so so glad that I came home early. This would have been a disaster.
