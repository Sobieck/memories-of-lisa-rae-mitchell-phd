Slept wellish at home. 6 hours of sleep (8-9 is ideal). 

Puttered around until I went on a run. My fucking watch for tracking runs didn't work so I just guessed. Ran ok, cried for part of. I also walked some of it which I try not to do, but I am trying to be gentle on myself. I can also run anytime I want, but it is hot as balls out there. My shirt was soaked through. 

I then took Gidget on a walk. She is moving slow. Gidget keeps just looking at me. She normally is asleep on her heating pads. But I think she is waiting to go great her mommy. Every day even on the worst days Gidget would stand on Lisaâ€™s bed and they would greet each other. On bad months it would be Gidgets only real interaction with Lisa. But she would waggle her little tail and put her head on the mattress while making little happy growling noises as Lisa talked to her. 

I got home and showered. Fucking bizarre. Normally I would have to wait till afternoon to shower because Lisa needed me during the mornings. Before the shower I threw away all of her bedding and stuff in that room. I'm going to miss her so much. Now I'm crying again. 

I ate a thing of instant noodles and cleaned the porch table and chairs. They were disgusting but I ate outside and Gidget barked at Dan when he yelled hello to us. 

Then I started to make this thing (the repo and these notes). During it I talked to Uthayla about spending time in London with her and her family. She invited Gidget too. Up to 6 months visa free to England apparently. 

I keep having these moments where I hear something or see something that I think would make Lisa laugh, I was always trying to do that, and realize that she isn't around anymore again. It is like a ghost appendage. 

While doing this I was listening to my music super low. This is habit because I needed to be able to hear Lisa. Now I have it loud while play.

I just heard her yell at me faintly and I turned around to go help, and then realized it was just my imagination. Fucking devastating.

Visited the mitchells. We talked abput lisa a bunch. I mentioned that I'm cleaning up the house and removing the various things that made the environment doable for Lisa. So thr house is much brighter and cheerful.
