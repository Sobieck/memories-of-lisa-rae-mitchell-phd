Had a much easier time falling asleep last night. Woke up at around 4. Got to work cleaning the basement at 5:15. Did that until 7:20ish. Went on a walk with he pup. Dad came over to help haul stuff to the bin. Cleaned out a bit more of the garage. 

Took a shower.

Made french toast. Gave a good amount to Gidget dog. 

Went over to the mitchell's. Ray was riding. I had a nice conversation with Robyn. Bella's class last night was really good apparently. 

I still can't bring myself to work on those forms, or even Lisa's memorial. I'm just not up to that sort of work. I need to figure out how to get them done next week. 

I'm making Couscous with Caramelized Fennel right now. 

Mal came over to drop off some home made biscuits while I was cooking. I ate the biscuits and couscous while we talked (she was full). So that was a nice surprise. I gave her some of the couscous to eat at home, but it wasn't my finest food I've ever made. I normally wouldn't give someone something unless it was the best, but this was the first time I made this dish... 

I ate some more couscous and then some fruit. 

Mary Claire is having ma and pa over at 3pm. So I'm going to head over there with a kn-95 on and stay outside. They have a pool so I might swim. 

Playing games tonight with my friends. I forgot that it was sunday.
