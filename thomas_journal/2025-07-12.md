woke up at 6. The dog woke me up by jumping on me at 1:30am. I don't know what was going on with her. I assume it was pain or something. I took her out and she peed. We then went to bed and got right back to sleep.

Went on a quick walk. My left leg is still bothering me and Gidget dog is still a bit out of it. But she ended up walking pretty good. Just with a lot of pauses, which was fine with me given my lack of pressing things to do and leg situation. 

Came home and researched restaurants. Found a list of dog friendly ones! So that is something to look forward to. The one we are going to go to on Monday for dinner is a mexican joint with a doggy menu. So gidget is going to eat well that night. I found even more so maybe not. One the places that Tony Bourdain went to is also dog friendly.

I need to eat and take a shower. 

I ate beans on toast. One of the dishes Lisa used to make me. It is so good. Heinz Beans, Fake Butter, Toast. 

Took a shower. I'm a bit out of it today. Gidget and I are going to go sit outside, listen to music, and read.
