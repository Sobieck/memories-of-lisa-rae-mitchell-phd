I slept really well last night. But I woke at 3 thinking, FUCK NOT AGAIN, but it was just tummy upset from eating rich meaty foods after a long time with much lighter fare and also I had some things to write about Lisa. I think I got back to sleep around 4. Woke up to bird song at 6. It was surprising to me. I haven't had that happen in several weeks.

I made gidget dog some scrambled eggs, she ate pretty well. I couldn't resist so I made two for me and felt bad (they were excellent). I'm trying to eat vegan because I'm sick of things suffering. I guess at least they were pasture raised.

Answered all the messages from overnight while listening to Iron & Wine. 

Wrote some in this. I almost took Gidget on a walk because I thought the rain let up, but it started pouring right when we were about to go out. Poor pup. 

I opened the blind on my giant south facing window in my entry way. Gloomy days were the worst around here given how we had everything covered up, but this really does wonders for the ambience of this place. 

Listening to Fleetwood Mac's Rumours now. I turned on a light in my office and it is so luxurious.
