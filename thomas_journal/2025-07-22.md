I thought I'd be nearly 100% today. But I'm out of it and my tummy this isn't 100% right. It hurts a bit. 

Woke up at five thirty. 

Took the pup on a short walk. Robyn is going to try to walk her later today. 

I'm listening to Beirut this morning. I don't think Lisa ever really listened to them with me. But I was first introduced to them right around the time I met Lisa and it has me very nostalgic about those times. The presickness parts of our relationship are just so bittersweet to remember for me. I just thought we'd have a lifetime together. One of the reasons I didn't want to have kids was because we were so happy together just spending time with each other. Why change something that is working? I think those times were truly the first time in my life that I was happy. I was extremely depressed in my teens and early twenties. But it was like my depression popped like a bubble when we started dating. I honestly haven't had many issues with depression since, even through all the trauma and caregiving. Ok, I'll revise that, I've been extremely depressed but it is situational. I was depressed because the person I loved was suffering and I could do virtually nothing about it. It wasn't just a miasma that enveloped me because of some bullshit in my brain chemistry.
