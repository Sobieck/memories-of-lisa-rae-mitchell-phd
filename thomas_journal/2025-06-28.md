Woke up at 1:30 feeling rested, looked at the clock and couldn't believe it. Then my brain started thinking about Lisa and this project to memorialize her. Fuck. I guess I'm a 4 hours kind of guy now. And I am not, in fact, feeling rested at all.

I'm going to buy a domain (lisamitchell.org) and point it at this repo. I also need to make an email so people can let me know if they want to be invited to the party or contribute to this thing. 

Ate some fruit at 3:50. I'm going on my weekly long run at 7. I'm meeting Mal at the forum park entrance, she is going to run a very short run. So my there and back is going to be all fucked. 

Notified the good doctors Lisa had of her death and thanked them. 

Looked through 2012 photos. Looking through pictures is so hard. We were so happy back then. 

Its fucking weird having lights on in this house. For years and years I haven't turned on lights very often because the light would hurt Lisa. Being able to have lights on any time I want is just odd and I'm having to think about putting them on. It is going to make gloomy days a lot less depressing.
