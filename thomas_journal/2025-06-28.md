Woke up at 1:30 feeling rested, looked at the clock and couldn't believe it. Then my brain started thinking about Lisa and this project to memorialize her. Fuck. I guess I'm a 4 hours kind of guy now. And I am not, in fact, feeling rested at all.

I'm going to buy a domain (lisamitchell.org) and point it at this repo. I also need to make an email so people can let me know if they want to be invited to the party or contribute to this thing. 

Ate some fruit at 3:50. I'm going on my weekly long run at 7. I'm meeting Mal at the forum park entrance, she is going to run a very short run. So my there and back is going to be all fucked. 

Notified the good doctors Lisa had of her death and thanked them.
