work up at 5:15. Gidget was off the bed by the door. So I put her out, ate a banana and PB, and then took her on her walk. 

When we got home I cleaned out part of the garage before it got too hot. I'm now eating fruit before I do a bit of the basement. I want to get done with the main finished room today. I'm guessing it will take me an hour or two. 

I cleaned out a bunch of the area where we stored decorations. Lisa just loved those things and it breaks my heart. I was crying for part of it. It was hard. I was also listening to Rebecca Solnit's _Orwell's Roses_ which didn't make it easier Solnit was describing Orwell's life after his wife died very young talking about having to visit places where they'd been happy together. If there was one thing we loved doing together towards the end of her life, it was decorating. I simply don't care that much about decorating, but she had an infectious enthusiasm about it and I loved seeing her happy. So I would do all the grunt work and she would do fiddly little things. She would make our house look beautiful and it gave her so much joy in her tiny little life. I was convinced that we'd turned a corner a month or two ago when she had me decorate for Summer. That was a great sign! She hadn't decorated in years. Within a month or so she was dead. I don't think she'd be dead right now if she hadn't sought treatment with the neurologist. I encouraged her to do that because her life was so hard and we needed a solution.
