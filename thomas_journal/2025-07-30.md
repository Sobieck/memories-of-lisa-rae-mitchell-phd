Work up at 4:45. Read in bed for a bit. Took Gidget on a walk at 5:30. Went on a run, six miles. It was so hot. I think that is breaking now with the thunderstorms coming through. I saw Mal for a tiny bit of the run. 

I came home finished up the finished part of the basement. I noticed that I have a mattress in the basement!! Meaning I'll probably have at least 1 more emptying of the bin before I'm done. 

I brought down my emergency water containers. That is always hell on my knees because water is heavy. I need to get rid of half of them because Lisa doesn't need water anymore. So I won't store any up stairs anymore which is nice I guess. 

Took a shower, brushed my teeths and the like. Ate some BLTs again. The lightlife fake bacon is really nice. It is salty but I guess that is what you are going for with a blt. 

The cleaners are going to be here today. They are doing a deep clean and should be here for like eight hours. I'm not looking forward to people being in my business but oh well. It is just one day and maybe I'll be able to stop taking allergy meds. 

I think I have arthritis in my thumb because of how tight Lisa used to have to have her sandals. They were velcro and she needed me to put my whole body into tightening them.
