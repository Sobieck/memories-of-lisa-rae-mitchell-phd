Woke up at three thirty for some reason. Maybe I'm getting less run down? Got out of bed at like four fifteen. Did my cleaning of the basement, then I went on a run at 6:20. 7 miles. So my weekend long one is already done. Had a lovely conversation with mal for a tiny part of that run. Took the dog on her walk. 

Had some new indian flavored ramen. It is really good! I'm so pleased. I didn't eat fruit like I should... but I was just so curious about this. 

I got a call telling me that the funeral home has the death certificates! Thank goodness. I'm going to be running up into some deadlines.
