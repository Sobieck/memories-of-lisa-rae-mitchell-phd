Slept in until seven. I just woke up from a dream. We were on a Farris wheel (we never were on a Farris wheel in real life). I kept on touching her and telling her I was so happy she was still here with me. Then I cried in the dream.

Was in bed until 2:30. Now I'm feeling OK. Got some solid food down. I think I'll feel normalish tomorrow. 

Poor Gidget is so sick of being in bed. 

Going to bed early tonight.

I just miss her so much.
